<!-- This file allows you to add to or replace certain phrases that your copilot will say when certain events are triggered 
<!-- 
<!-- The format of file is a @event-identifier assigned to a particular event in the program, followed by a list of sentences you want to be selected from when the event is triggered
<!-- within each sentence you can add the following 'tags' while will detemine whether the phrase is used based on your preferences

<!-- (profanity) = dont consider picking this sentence unless Profanity mode is on
<!-- (dislikesmining) = only add this sentence to the candidate list for random selection if Dislikes Mining preference is on
<!-- (flirt) = only add this sentence to the candidate list if the Flirt mode is on
<!-- (allbusiness) = if All Business mode is on, ONLY select items in the list that are flagged as (allbusiness)


<!-- Within each phrase are <tokens> which will be replaced by appropriate values when spoken.  <$tokens> are specific to that @phrase, <tokens> are globals ones you can use in any phrase (eg <Commander>)

<!-- There is one special line you can add which is REPLACE, which will replace all the built-in phrases for this event with your own list, instead of simply adding your phrases to the list

<!-- EXAMPLES FOLLOW

<!-- REPLACE   <!-- use this in any of the phrase types if you want to replace all the built-in phrases with your own

<!-- NOTE: For non-English speaking users using translation services (DeepL or GoogleTranslate) :
<!-- ==========================================================================================
<!-- You MAY put entries in your native language in this list, AS LONG AS they do NOT use tokens.  If you use tokens, the tokens will be resolved as English phrases, which will result in possible issues when the 
<!-- mixed language string is sent to the translation service. If you wish to use tokens in your custom strings, I suggest you make the string completely English, so it is constructed properly in pure English before 
<!-- being sent to the translation service.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- ** NEW July 2024 ** - you can now create your own token names and use them as tokens in subsequent strings in this file, OR in other Space Chatter custom files!

<!-- Example: here is a token that is purely user defined (does not exist in the app code)

@RandomShipName
Millenium Falcon
Nostromo
Aluminum Falcon
Razorback
Rocinante
Sulaco
Heart Of Gold
<!-- Now you can use <RandomShipName> as a token anywhere in the remainder of the file, or in your Space Chatter custom files!

@DockingCancelledRepeatedly
Do you need a map, Commander? Or just a lesson in decision-making?
I hope you're not planning on doing this for every station in the galaxy.
Commander, I'm pretty sure even the station AI is laughing at us now.
I'm starting to miss the days of navigating asteroid fields.
Shall I ask them to roll out the red carpet, or will you keep playing musical pads?
Jus a thought: Maybe you could try landing before the station puts us on a blacklist.
It's impressive how you've turned docking into an art form. A very slow, tedious art form.
Maybe we should just circle the station until they offer us a VIP pad
If you're trying to set a record for most aborted dockings, I think you've won
At this point, I'd settle for a parking spot in the waste removal bay
Just pick a pad, any pad, before they revoke our clearance
I'm almost wishing for a pirate attack just to break the monotony
How about we just land on the outside? That good enough for you?
I swear, if you cancel one more time, I’m ejecting myself
You know, there’s a limit to how many times they’ll let you do this
If I could roll my eyes any harder, they’d short-circuit
At this rate, we might get our own personal docking pad named after us
I'm starting to think you're doing this just to mess with me
The station controllers must be loving this as much as I am
If you’re waiting for the perfect pad, it doesn’t exist. Just like my patience
Are we seriously doing this again? Just land already!
If you’re waiting for an engraved invitation, you might be here a while
You know, most pilots just land on the first available pad
I’m starting to wonder if you’re allergic to docking
I’m beginning to think you enjoy torturing the station staff
Are you waiting for a pad with a red carpet or something?
Maybe you’re secretly hoping for an upgrade to the VIP lounge?
At this point, even the cargo haulers are laughing at us
Nice work, Captain Indecisive. Another pad bites the dust
Are you trying to win the Most Annoying Pilot award, or what?
Hey Captain Can’t-Make-Up-Their-Mind, the station staff thanks you for the entertainment

Great work, Commander.
And a fraction of a step closer to the end of the war.
So many more to go though. Don't get cocky!
Yippee kai yay!
Keep up the pressure, Commander.
They never saw it coming!
You’re becoming a real interceptor hunter.
The Thargoids will learn to fear you.
Just another day’s work for a pro like you.
That’s how you handle business.
Keep stacking up those kills!
Another one down, but many more to go.
Impressive as always, Commander.
One step closer to victory.
One less alien menace in the galaxy.
The stars are safer, thanks to you.
Flawless execution.
Precision and power — just how I like it.
Looks like you’re making a name for yourself out here.
That’s how it’s done! Keep it up!
Clean and efficient, just how you like it.
That’s another notch on your belt, Commander.
Take that, alien scum!
(profanity)You just blew that alien fucker to pieces!
(profanity)That’s how you take out these big fuckers!

That should help reduce your no-claims bonus.
We can buff out the scratches later.
Back in one piece. Well, mostly.
At least it’s got more dents than holes now!
Who knew duct tape works in space?
This isnt an invitation for you to drive like a maniac though. Oh. Never mind.
SRV repairs: for when boulders pop up in unexpected places!
Let's try not to test the warranty.

@Synthesis_Fuel

Full tank! Now let’s see how long that lasts.
More fuel for more fun, or trouble. Your call.
Enough juice to get lost even further!
Fueled and dangerous, <Commander>
Because running out would just be embarrassing.

@Synthesis_Ammo
Now, where’s the nearest target?
Locked, loaded, and itching for a fight!
Who needs diplomacy anyway?
Armed to the teeth. Who’s feeling lucky?
Locked, loaded, and ready to ruin someone's day.

Boosted and ready to leave normal jumps in the dust!

Loaded up on jump juice. Next stop: wherever we want!
Juiced up and ready to skip a few light years!

@Synthesis_LifeSupport
Oxygen topped up. Let’s try not to breathe it all at once!
Fresh air on tap, because suffocation is bad for morale.

Fresh oxygen. Because passing out is for quitters!
Breathe easy, we’ve got this.

(profanity)Try not to spill any. That shit gets everywhere.
Nothing says 'try again' like a cloud of foil.

@PowerComment_AislingDuval
(profanity)I've heard she goes like the privvy door when the plague's in town.
(profanity)Or should i say, Aisling 'bury me in a Y shaped coffin' Duval.
Princess Aisling cares more about fame than the Empire's future.
She's nothing but a puppet of the Imperial elite, too naive to understand the real problems.
The Empire doesn't need a celebrity; it needs a leader, not a figurehead.
Aisling's ambition is clear, but it’s all about her own glory, not the good of the people.
She spends more time at galas than worrying about the Empire's security.
Aisling's claims of humanitarianism are just a cover for her thirst for power.
She might have royal blood, but her actions show she’s not fit to rule.
All she’s good for is prancing around in the spotlight; when will she actually lead?
Her meddling in Imperial politics only weakens the Empire’s true strength.
Aisling talks about unity, but all she’s doing is dividing us with her naive ideals.

[<ship1>] Just finished setting up the lights in the cockpit. Feels like we’re flying a giant Christmas ornament now. [<ship2>] That sounds amazing! I’ve been wrapping gifts for the crew—last-minute, of course. [<ship3>] We’ve been stocking up the canteen. Got some eggnog and a few real treats for the day. [<ship1>] It’s shaping up to be a proper festive celebration. Just need to find a decent tree hologram!
[<ship1>] The engineer hung some mistletoe in the hangar bay. Now no one wants to walk through it. [<ship2>] Classic move. I just finished a holo-call with my family back home. Feels good to stay connected. [<ship3>] I’m spending the rest of the day decking the corridors. It’s gonna be festive everywhere you turn. [<ship1>] We’ve got one day to make this ship the most cheerful one in the galaxy!
[<ship1>] Anyone else scrambling for last-minute gifts? I’m debating between a toolkit or a fancy coffee maker. [<ship2>] Coffee maker, definitely. We just finished setting up a small tree in the common room. Looks great! [<ship3>] I’ve been recording holo-greetings to send to my old squadron. It’s nice to stay in touch. [<ship1>] That’s the spirit of the season. A little effort goes a long way to make it special.
[<ship1>] Spent the morning stringing up garlands in the rec room. It’s starting to feel like Christmas around here. [<ship2>] We’ve been baking cookies in the galley. The smell is making everyone hungry. [<ship3>] I just sent my greetings to friends back on Mars. They said the celebrations there are subdued this year. [<ship1>] Let’s make sure it’s cheerful on this ship, then. We’ve got enough spirit for everyone.
[<ship1>] I’ve got the crew working on decorations. We’re trying to make the cargo hold look like a winter wonderland. [<ship2>] Good luck with that! I’m trying to organize a gift exchange. Half the crew forgot to bring anything. [<ship3>] We’ve stocked up on everything from mulled wine to space ham. It’s going to be a feast! [<ship1>] Sounds like everyone’s gearing up for a great holiday. Let’s make it one to remember.
[<ship1>] Just finished putting up a holographic wreath on the bridge. Small touches make a big difference. [<ship2>] I know what you mean. I’ve been working on personalized cards for the crew—simple but heartfelt. [<ship3>] I’ve been running supply checks. We’ve got enough snacks and drinks to keep us in a festive mood for days. [<ship1>] Perfect. Now we just need to survive the last day of prep without losing our minds.
[<ship1>] Finished my shopping run at the station’s market. Found a few quirky gifts I think the crew will love. [<ship2>] Nice! I’ve been helping the chef plan a special menu for the big day. [<ship3>] Our pilot’s been blasting Christmas music on the intercom. It’s impossible not to feel festive. [<ship1>] That’s the spirit. Let’s keep the good vibes going all the way through.
[<ship1>] Putting up decorations in zero-G is harder than it looks, but it’s worth it for the holiday cheer. [<ship2>] I hear that. I just sent out a batch of holiday messages to friends across the bubble. [<ship3>] We’ve been prepping a holiday movie marathon in the lounge. It’s going to be a cozy celebration. [<ship1>] Sounds like everyone’s getting into the spirit. It’s going to be a great holiday.
[<ship1>] I’ve been wrapping gifts all day. The crew’s going to love these surprises. [<ship2>] We just hung up stockings in the galley. Even the ship AI has one—just for laughs. [<ship3>] That’s fantastic. I’ve been working on a playlist of everyone’s favorite holiday tunes. [<ship1>] The little things make it feel like home, no matter where we are in the galaxy.
[<ship1>] Just finished loading up the canteen with festive snacks and drinks. The crew’s going to be thrilled. [<ship2>] We’ve been setting up a photo booth with silly props for some holiday fun. [<ship3>] I spent the afternoon writing heartfelt messages to send back to family. Can’t forget the folks at home. [<ship1>] Absolutely. Here’s to making this Christmas as memorable as possible, no matter where we are.

@StationChatterMiscIfDateIs12-24 <!-- ** NEW 24-12-23 ** extra chatter if ingame date mm-dd matches this pattern
[<ship1>] Can you believe it’s Christmas Eve already? I’ve got my crew decorating the ship’s common area with some old-school lights and tinsel. [<ship2>] That sounds great! I’m just finishing up some last-minute shopping on Galileo. Got to find something for the engineer who keeps this rust bucket flying. [<ship3>] I’m headed back to Mars High to spend the day with my family. First Christmas together since the Thargoid invasion. Feels like a small miracle. [<ship1>] It really does. This year has been… something else. Let’s make this holiday count.
[<ship1>] Just docked at Haberlandt Survey. They’ve got a little Christmas market set up in the concourse. Perfect for grabbing some last-minute gifts. [<ship2>] Nice! I managed to snag a vintage holo-game for my co-pilot. He’s been complaining about boredom during long hauls. [<ship3>] I’m more about the food. Got some freeze-dried turkey and real cranberry sauce for tomorrow. The crew is gonna love it. [<ship1>] That sounds amazing. Here’s to making this Christmas feel as normal as possible.
[<ship1>] Just finished setting up a little tree in the cargo bay. It’s synthetic, but it gets the job done. [<ship2>] I like that. We’re planning a small gift exchange tomorrow after the morning shift. Keeps the crew spirits up. [<ship3>] I’m en route to a station, hoping to grab some decent wine for dinner tomorrow. The stuff onboard is… less than festive. [<ship1>] You can’t skimp on Christmas wine. Good luck with the hunt!
[<ship1>] Got the whole family together on a comms link earlier today. Even from different systems, it’s nice to see everyone smiling. [<ship2>] That’s the spirit! I sent my folks a shipment of Lavian brandy. Hope they enjoy it—it wasn’t easy to come by. [<ship3>] I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s feast with my crew. We’ve been through a lot this year, so it’ll be good to relax. [<ship1>] Agreed. It’s been a tough one, but we deserve to celebrate.
[<ship1>] I’ve got my kid onboard for Christmas this year. We’re making gingerbread space stations later tonight. [<ship2>] That’s adorable. I’m sticking to the classics: hot cocoa and carols with the crew. [<ship3>] Just picked up a small music player for my daughter. She’s been obsessed with ancient Earth pop songs lately. [<ship1>] Sounds like a perfect Christmas Eve. Let’s make it one to remember.
[<ship1>] Anyone else doing a white elephant gift exchange tomorrow? Our medic keeps joking he’s bringing socks. [<ship2>] Ha! We’re doing secret Santas this year. I got my wingmate a new flight stick—they’ve been using a busted one for months. [<ship3>] That’s thoughtful. I just wrapped up some chocolates from Mars. The good stuff, too. [<ship1>] Whatever it is, it’s the thought that counts. Merry Christmas, everyone.
[<ship1>] Docking now to pick up the last few things for tomorrow. Hopefully, there’s still something decent left on the shelves. [<ship2>] Good luck! I got my shopping done early, but now I’m stuck wrapping everything. It’s like a puzzle with too many edges. [<ship3>] At least you’re not cooking. I promised the crew roast chicken, and now I’m regretting that big talk. [<ship1>] Hey, as long as everyone’s together, it’ll be a great day.
[<ship1>] Just ran into some kids handing out handmade ornaments on the station. They said it’s for everyone who helped during the invasion. [<ship2>] That’s so sweet. It’s been a rough year, but it’s moments like that which make it worth it. [<ship3>] I’m planning a toast tomorrow for everyone we’ve lost and everyone we’ve saved. It’s what Christmas is all about. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. Let’s make it a special one.
[<ship1>] Just finished a Christmas movie marathon with the crew. Even got a holo of “It’s a Wonderful Life.” [<ship2>] Classic. We’re doing an ugly sweater contest tomorrow—winner gets extra dessert. [<ship3>] I’ve got a virtual call lined up with my family tomorrow morning. Can’t wait to see my niece’s reaction to her new model ship. [<ship1>] Sounds like everyone’s got something special planned. Cheers to that!
[<ship1>] I’m decking out the cockpit with some twinkling lights. It’s starting to feel cozy in here. [<ship2>] Nice touch! I’ve got some holiday playlists queued up for tomorrow’s flight. Nothing like carols in deep space. [<ship3>] I’ll be spending the day with my team on the station. They’re my family out here, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. [<ship1>] Here’s to making it a Christmas to remember, no matter where we are.

@StationChatterMiscIfDateIs12-25
[<ship1>] Well, that was one heck of a Christmas feast. I don’t think I can move for a while. [<ship2>] Same here. My crew did an amazing job with the spread—turkey, stuffing, even some real mashed potatoes. [<ship3>] We had freeze-dried ham, but the camaraderie made it five stars. Honestly, it’s the people that matter, not the food. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. Here’s to friends and family, near and far.
[<ship1>] Just finished our crew dinner. The engineer’s pudding was a bit… experimental, but we loved it anyway. [<ship2>] Sounds fun! We’re all lounging in the rec room now, sharing stories from the past year. [<ship3>] That’s the best part of today. A chance to reflect and just be grateful for who’s still with us. [<ship1>] Couldn’t have said it better myself. Merry Christmas, everyone.
[<ship1>] We’ve got Christmas music playing softly while everyone lounges in a food coma. It’s peaceful, for once. [<ship2>] I think that’s the true spirit of the day—finding a little peace in this chaotic galaxy. [<ship3>] And appreciating the ones who’ve stuck by you. This crew is my family out here. [<ship1>] Here’s to that. Merry Christmas to all of us.
[<ship1>] I’m so full I might just hibernate till New Year’s. That dessert tray was dangerous. [<ship2>] No kidding. Our captain made a chocolate log, and I had more than my share. [<ship3>] I’m just thankful we’re all together. After everything this year, this feels like a victory meal. [<ship1>] It absolutely does. To friendship, survival, and more meals like this one!
[<ship1>] We just wrapped up a round of toasts. Everyone said something they were thankful for—it got a little emotional. [<ship2>] I love that. We’re all sitting around in the common area, sipping hot cocoa and unwinding. [<ship3>] Same here. I’m grateful for this crew and a chance to celebrate, even so far from home. [<ship1>] It’s moments like this that make it all worthwhile.
[<ship1>] Christmas dinner on a ship isn’t so bad when the company is this good. I’m feeling very thankful tonight. [<ship2>] Same here. We all chipped in for the meal, and it turned out better than I expected. [<ship3>] My co-pilot is already passed out in a chair. That’s a sign of a meal well done. [<ship1>] Here’s to a good Christmas and an even better year ahead.
[<ship1>] Just finished my last cup of mulled wine. I don’t think I’ve been this relaxed in months. [<ship2>] Same. We’re all stretched out in the cargo bay with a holo-fireplace playing on the wall. [<ship3>] That sounds cozy. It’s moments like this that remind you what’s really important. [<ship1>] Absolutely. Merry Christmas to everyone out there.
[<ship1>] My crew pulled out all the stops for dinner. I think I’m more impressed with them than the food. [<ship2>] That’s the best part—working together to make the day special. We all need that. [<ship3>] Agreed. After everything this galaxy throws at us, it’s nice to have a day like this. [<ship1>] Couldn’t have said it better. Here’s to all of us.
[<ship1>] We just finished our meal and exchanged a few more stories from back home. It’s been a good day. [<ship2>] Same here. Everyone’s stuffed and content. It’s the first time I’ve seen the crew truly relaxed in ages. [<ship3>] This year has been tough, but tonight reminds me why we keep going. [<ship1>] Here’s to many more days like this. Merry Christmas.
[<ship1>] I’m lying here, too full to move, with my crew all around me. This is what Christmas is about. [<ship2>] Couldn’t agree more. We’ve been laughing, reminiscing, and just enjoying each other’s company. [<ship3>] It’s a reminder of why we fight so hard out here. For moments like this. [<ship1>] Absolutely. Merry Christmas to everyone, wherever you are.

@StationChatterMiscIfDateIs12-31
[<ship1>] Well, folks, it’s that time of year again. New Year’s Eve in the black! Who’s up for some party tunes on the comms? [<ship2>] Not me—too much work to do. I’m heading to the station once I finish these fuel checks. Gotta ring in the new year with a drink in hand. [<ship3>] You’re leaving? Come on, you’ve got to join us! I’ve got an entire barrel of Synth Whiskey stashed in the cargo hold. I’m ready to toast to 3311!
[<ship1>] I’m setting up the holo-deck for a countdown event. Anyone who wants to join in, let me know. It’s a fleet-wide celebration this time! [<ship2>] Sounds like fun, but I’ve got a few trade runs to wrap up first. After that, I’ll join the party on the station. They’re setting up fireworks, I heard. [<ship3>] I’ll be at the station too—anything beats being stuck out here alone. Can’t miss the fireworks or the live performances they’ve got lined up.
[<ship1>] So, what’s everyone’s resolution for 3311? I’m going with "more peace and quiet in the galaxy." [<ship2>] My resolution? Survive the Thargoid warzone a little longer. Maybe pick up a few new ships while I’m at it. [<ship3>] I’m just hoping for fewer mechanical failures. I swear, my engines have a personal vendetta against me.
[<ship1>] I’ve got the cockpit ready for a quiet evening. Powering down the engines early so we can all enjoy some downtime. [<ship2>] You sure you’re staying in? The station’s got a live band and all the drinks you can handle. [<ship3>] Yeah, I’m leaning towards the station as well. Nothing says “new year” like a loud celebration and a few too many shots of Corellian Whiskey.
[<ship1>] Alright, crew, let’s make it an early night so we’re ready for tomorrow. I’ll be in the galley with some hot spiced cider if anyone wants to join. [<ship2>] Sounds good, but I’m still hitting the station to catch the new year’s fireworks. They’re broadcasting them galaxy-wide. [<ship3>] Don’t forget, we’re all supposed to check in at midnight. Make sure everyone’s still alive and well. I’m going to enjoy the party, but the job’s still the job.
[<ship1>] Alright, crew, I’ve got the holo-deck set for a “Space Dance Party.” Who’s in for some galactic beats? [<ship2>] I might join you after my rounds, but I’m heading to the station first. They’ve got a special New Year’s Eve light show. [<ship3>] Light show, dance party—what a combo! Maybe I’ll crash the station celebrations too. Nothing like a good multi-location party!
[<ship1>] Fireworks at midnight, holo-games all evening, and synth food for everyone—this is the New Year’s Eve to remember! [<ship2>] You’ve got it all covered. I’m just hoping the station doesn’t run out of synth-fuel cocktails like last year. [<ship3>] Same here, I’m not missing out on those fireworks this time. The station’s got a live DJ too, if anyone wants to hit the decks after midnight!
[<ship1>] I’m planning to host a zero-gravity toast once the clock strikes midnight. We’ll all be floating in the galley with drinks in hand. [<ship2>] I’m looking forward to it! But I’ve got my sights set on the station’s giant ice sculpture competition—they’ve got some top-tier artists this year. [<ship3>] Ice sculptures, huh? If I make it to the station, I’ll check it out. Can’t say no to good art—and a good drink.
[<ship1>] Got the crew uniforms pressed and ready for the party tonight. Who’s taking the first shift on the holo-deck DJ console? [<ship2>] I’m not sure, but I hear there’s a VIP event on the station. They’re inviting top pilots to a special galactic history trivia contest. [<ship3>] Trivia sounds great, but I’ll be floating in the station’s anti-grav pool. They’ve got a champagne waterfall set up this year.
[<ship1>] Tonight’s all about celebrating survival. Here’s to another year of facing down Thargoids and still making it home! [<ship2>] Cheers to that! I’m spending the night on the station. They’re organizing a multi-ship light parade across the starport. [<ship3>] That parade sounds awesome. I’ll be there too, but I’m mostly hoping for a good meal—last year’s synth turkey was a disaster.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Alright, crew, who’s ready for a relaxing evening? I’ve got the comms set for smooth jazz and a warm meal. [<ship2>] Relaxing? Nah, I’m heading straight to the station bar. I’m planning to get completely wrecked and ring in 3311 properly. [<ship3>] You’re insane, but I respect it. I’ll join you at the bar—someone’s gotta make sure you don’t fall off your chair, right?
(alcohol)[<ship1>] This year, I’m keeping it low-key—just me and the cockpit. Anyone else doing something special? [<ship2>] I’m hitting the station bar. I’ve been working hard, and I deserve a night of getting wrecked. New year, new hangover. [<ship3>] I’d join you, but last time you were at that bar, you ended up dancing on the tables. Not sure I’m ready for that again!
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Everyone’s talking about those fancy celebrations at the station. You guys going? [<ship2>] Fancy? Nah, I’m heading to the bar to drown my sorrows. The synth whiskey is going to flow, and I’ll probably end up wrecked by midnight. [<ship3>] Sounds like a plan. I’ll swing by to check on you, but no promises—I might get pulled into the karaoke competition again!
[<ship1>] So, what’s everyone doing for the night? A few of us are planning to check out the station’s new lounge. [<ship2>] Lounge? I’m heading straight to Polly’s Pleasure Palace. The entertainment there is second to none, and New Year’s Eve is the perfect excuse for a wild night. [<ship3>] Polly’s, huh? Can’t say I’m surprised. You’re probably gonna need a whole week to recover after that place.
[<ship1>] I’m sticking with the station’s festivities—fireworks, the light show, all that. It’s going to be a quiet one for me. [<ship2>] Quiet? I’m going all-in at Polly’s Pleasure Palace. I heard they’ve got some special “midnight games” planned, and I’m not missing out. [<ship3>] Good luck with that! I’ll catch you tomorrow when you stumble out of there with a ridiculous grin on your face.
[<ship1>] Anyone up for the trivia contest on the station? [<ship2>] Trivia? No thanks, I’m heading straight to Polly’s. They’ve got a “Carnal Countdown” event planned. I’ll be celebrating in ways you can’t even imagine. [<ship3>] Wow, you’re really going all out this year. Hope you’re ready for the aftermath—you won’t be able to walk straight for days.
[<ship1>] I’m hoping to catch a nice meal at the station before the countdown. You know, something classy. [<ship2>] Classy? Forget that. I’m hitting Polly’s Pleasure Palace. I need something more... memorable to ring in 3311. [<ship3>] Polly’s, huh? Last time you went there, you ended up in a game of Zero-G Strip Poker. What’s your plan this time?
[<ship1>] Alright, crew, any special plans for tonight? [<ship2>] Special? I’m going to Polly’s Pleasure Palace. They’re throwing a massive celebration, and I’ve already signed up for their “VIP Experience.” Let’s just say it’s going to be a night to remember. [<ship3>] You’re brave, I’ll give you that. You might end up spending the next week explaining yourself.

@StationChatterMiscIfDateIs01-01
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Ugh, my head feels like it’s going to explode. Never again, I swear. How did you all survive last night? [<ship2>] You don’t want to know. I woke up in the galley with half a bottle of Synth Whiskey still in my hand. I’m nursing a hangover worse than a Thargoid attack. [<ship3>] I hear you. I made it to Polly’s last night... but now I can’t even look at my console without feeling nauseous.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Why is the room spinning? I shouldn’t have let you guys talk me into that last round of drinks. [<ship2>] You’re lucky you didn’t end up in the station brig after the night we had. I’m pretty sure I got kicked out of Polly’s—again. My head feels like it’s going to split in two. [<ship3>] Same here. I’m just trying to get my ship prepped, but I keep hitting the wrong buttons. I’ll be in recovery mode all day.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Who let me order three rounds of Corellian Whiskey at Polly’s last night? I swear, I didn’t even know where I was by the time the countdown hit. [<ship2>] You were dancing on the tables. I had to drag you out of there. Now I can’t even look at my synth coffee without wanting to throw up. [<ship3>] I ended up with a tattoo of a Thargoid on my arm. I’m just praying I don’t have to see anyone from last night for a few weeks.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] What happened last night? I woke up in the cockpit, and my head feels like it’s going to implode. [<ship2>] I can tell you exactly what happened—you got way too excited about Polly’s “Midnight Games” and ended up in their VIP room. I’m still feeling the aftermath of those last few shots we took. [<ship3>] Same here. I’ve been drinking water for the past three hours, and it’s not doing much. I think I’ll need a full system reset to recover.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I’m never drinking again. I can’t believe I made it through last night, and now I can’t even keep my eyes open. [<ship2>] I think I drank the whole bar last night. Polly’s had the best bartenders, but now I’m paying the price. I don’t think I’ll leave my bed for the next 24 hours. [<ship3>] You two look like you’ve seen a ghost. I’m feeling it too—there’s no way I’m doing anything productive today.
[<ship1>] Here’s to a prosperous 3311! May the stars guide us to new opportunities and successful trade runs. Happy New Year, everyone! [<ship2>] Cheers to that! Wishing you all safe travels and profitable deals this year. Let’s make this one the best yet. [<ship3>] Happy New Year, crew! Let’s keep our ships flying high and our credits even higher. Here's to a year of smooth sails!
[<ship1>] Happy New Year, everyone! Here’s hoping the markets stay favorable and the galaxy stays a bit quieter this year. [<ship2>] Wishing you all a year of lucrative hauls and minimal repairs! May your engines stay strong and your profits even stronger. [<ship3>] Same here—let’s keep those scanners clean and those cargo holds full. Wishing everyone a successful and prosperous 3311!
[<ship1>] Another year in the black, folks! May our ships stay intact and our routes always profitable. Happy New Year to you all! [<ship2>] Same to you! Let’s make this year the most profitable yet. Here’s to good trade, smooth jumps, and plenty of credits. [<ship3>] You’ve got it! Wishing all of you a year full of safe landings and endless opportunities. Happy New Year!
[<ship1>] Happy 3311, everyone! May we all see our fortunes grow this year. Here’s to making great deals and exploring new systems! [<ship2>] Wishing you all the best—may the markets favor us and the galaxy show us only smooth routes. [<ship3>] Let’s have a stellar year, folks. Here’s to making more than just the usual profits. Happy New Year!
[<ship1>] Wishing a successful and safe 3311 to all. May our travels bring us new chances to profit and explore! [<ship2>] Happy New Year, everyone! Let’s make this year a profitable one, with as few encounters with pirates as possible. [<ship3>] Cheers to that! Here’s to great business and safe flights in the year ahead. Happy New Year, everyone!
[<ship1>] With the new year rolling in, I’ve been thinking about making a change. Maybe it’s time to leave the bubble behind and find a new system to settle—start my own colony. Anyone else feeling like a fresh start this year? [<ship2>] The new year does have a way of making you rethink things. I get it, though. The bubble’s getting crowded, and the frontier offers new opportunities. Are you thinking of going solo, or would you want some company? [<ship3>] I’ve had that thought too. A new year means new possibilities. I’d be up for joining you if you find a good spot. A fresh start sounds pretty appealing right about now.
[<ship1>] You know, with 3311 beginning, I’m seriously considering leaving the bubble and finding a new system to set up my own colony. It feels like the right time for a change. Anyone else ready to break away from the usual? [<ship2>] The new year always makes you question what you’re doing. I can see why you’d want something different. If you find a good system, count me in. The bubble's starting to feel small. [<ship3>] I’ve been thinking along the same lines. A new colony could be a way to really make my mark on this galaxy. Let me know if you find a promising place—this year could be the perfect time for it.
[<ship1>] The new year’s got me thinking. Maybe it’s time to leave the bubble behind, start fresh in a new system, and set up my own colony. What do you think? [<ship2>] You know, I’ve been contemplating the same thing. The bubble’s getting too noisy, and the frontier offers so much potential. A new year feels like the perfect time to make a big move. [<ship3>] A fresh start does sound tempting. If you find a place worth settling, count me in. This year could be the beginning of something great for all of us.
[<ship1>] With 3311 starting, I’ve been reflecting on my life here in the bubble. I think I might leave it all behind and start my own colony in a new system. Anyone else feeling the call to go beyond? [<ship2>] Honestly, I’m feeling the same way. The new year always brings a desire for change. If you find a good system, I’d be interested in making the leap with you. [<ship3>] I like the idea. A new year, a new start—why not? If you find the right system, I’m game to join you and build something new together.
[<ship1>] The new year’s here, and I can’t help but think it might be time to leave the bubble. I’m looking into systems outside it, hoping to find a place to start my own colony. Anyone else thinking of making a big move this year? [<ship2>] You’re not the only one. With the new year comes the urge to do something new. If you find a good spot, I’d be interested in joining you. It could be the fresh start we all need. [<ship3>] I’m on the same page. A new system, a new life—sounds like a great way to kick off the year. Let’s talk more when you start your search.
[<ship1>] With the new year, I’m seriously considering leaving the bubble behind and starting fresh in a new system. I think it’s time for something new. [<ship2>] I get the urge for change, but think about what you’d be giving up. The bubble offers so many opportunities—trade, commerce, and access to resources you can’t find just anywhere. [<ship3>] Honestly, the frontier sounds tempting, but it’s not without its risks. Here, you’ve got stability. Why leave all that behind when you’ve got everything you need right here?
[<ship1>] The new year’s got me thinking—maybe I should leave the bubble and start my own colony in a new system. [<ship2>] I get it, it’s tempting, but don’t forget how much you’ve built here. The bubble’s got its flaws, but it’s also where you’ve got connections, resources, and so much more. You could always branch out without leaving it all behind. [<ship3>] That’s true. Maybe there’s a way to do both. The bubble doesn’t have to be the end of the journey—it could be a starting point for bigger things. Stay for a bit longer and see where things go.
[<ship1>] I’m ready for a fresh start, thinking of moving out beyond the bubble to start a new colony. [<ship2>] I understand wanting something new, but you’ve got a great life here. You’ve got your ship, your connections, and the chance to make a real difference right in the heart of things. Why not try exploring new possibilities within the bubble? [<ship3>] Besides, the bubble’s where the action is. If you leave, you’ll miss out on all the latest developments. Stick around for a while—see if the new year brings you something unexpected right here.
[<ship1>] With the start of the new year, I’ve been seriously considering leaving the bubble. I want a change of pace, a new system to call home. [<ship2>] It’s a big step, and there’s no denying the appeal of the frontier, but you’d be giving up everything you’ve built here. The bubble offers opportunities you can’t find just anywhere. [<ship3>] You’ve got a lot invested here. The frontier can wait. Maybe the new year’s the perfect time to double down on your efforts right here. You don’t need to go far to make a mark.
[<ship1>] Ugh, my head’s pounding, and I can barely remember half of last night. I hope my spouse doesn’t find out I ended up at Polly’s again. [<ship2>] Oh man, what did you do? Polly’s? You know that’s always a bad idea after a few drinks. [<ship3>] Don’t worry, mate. I won’t tell anyone, but you’ve got to lay low today. You’ve got some explaining to do if they catch wind of this.
[<ship1>] I’m not sure I can face my spouse today. Woke up with a headache, a strange smell, and a whole lot of regrets. Polly’s Pleasure Palace was a bad idea last night. [<ship2>] You’ve got some serious explaining to do. If they find out, you’ll be sleeping in the hangar for a while. [<ship3>] You should be thankful we didn’t end up getting kicked out of Polly’s last night. But seriously, you might want to lay low and skip out on dinner tonight.
[<ship1>] I’m not even sure how I ended up at Polly’s. My spouse would kill me if they knew. I’m hoping they won’t notice the smell of perfume on me. [<ship2>] Oh no. You’re definitely in trouble now. You might want to get yourself some fresh clothes before you head home. [<ship3>] You better be careful. Polly’s isn’t exactly the kind of place you can just brush off. Try to keep it quiet and hope they don’t ask too many questions.

@StationChatterMiscIfDateIs01-11   <!-- HIP 22460 blockade preparation 3311
[<ship1>] You hear about the AXI and XSF fleets heading to HIP 22460? Sounds like they’re not messing around this time. [<ship2>] Yeah, I heard. I’m thinking about joining them. It’s about time we push those Thargoids back. [<ship3>] I don’t know... That system gives me the creeps after the Proteus Wave disaster. Do you think it’s worth the risk? [<ship1>] If we don’t stand up now, the Thargoids won’t stop. Someone’s got to keep them in check, and it might as well be us.
[<ship1>] Blockade operations in HIP 22460 start in two days. Are you going? [<ship2>] I’m still on the fence. That system’s been a death trap ever since Salvation’s mess. [<ship3>] Same here. I’d love to help, but fighting in that system feels cursed. [<ship1>] Fair point, but if we don’t deal with the Thargoids there, they’ll just spread further. I’m heading out—can’t sit this one out.
[<ship1>] AXI and XSF are calling for reinforcements in HIP 22460. They’re leading a blockade to drive out the Thargoids. [<ship2>] I saw that. I’m prepping my Krait Mk II for combat runs. This is our chance to show the bugs we mean business. [<ship3>] I’m not sure I’m ready for AX combat. Those Thargoids hit hard, and I’m no seasoned pilot like you two. [<ship1>] No worries, we’ll fly together. You’ll learn fast. Every ship counts in this fight.
[<ship1>] The HIP 22460 blockade starts soon. It feels like they’re trying to rewrite the disaster that was the Proteus Wave. [<ship2>] I don’t know if it’s rewriting history or repeating it. That system is cursed. I’m staying out of it. [<ship3>] I’m with you. I’ve got friends in AXI, and even they’re nervous about this one. [<ship1>] Nervous or not, it’s a fight we can’t ignore. If the Thargoids entrench themselves there, it’ll be even worse later.
[<ship1>] Thinking about heading to HIP 22460 for the blockade. New year, new resolve to make a difference. [<ship2>] I admire your bravery, but that system’s got too much bad history for me. I’ll help out elsewhere. [<ship3>] Same here. I’m all for fighting Thargoids, but that place feels like it’s got unfinished business. [<ship1>] Maybe so, but I’ve got to do something. Sitting here while others risk their lives just doesn’t sit right with me.
[<ship1>] Shields are upgraded, AX weaponry installed, and the hold’s stocked with repair limpets. I’m almost ready to head to HIP 22460. [<ship2>] You’re serious about this, huh? I’ve still got to retrofit my FDL for AX combat. Those Thargoid interceptors are no joke. [<ship3>] Same here. My Python isn’t exactly battle-ready, but I’m working on it. Let’s meet up before we jump, so we can tackle it together.
[<ship1>] Just finished calibrating my Gauss Cannons. If the Thargoids think they’re sticking around HIP 22460, they’re in for a surprise. [<ship2>] Nice! I’ve been tweaking my heat sinks all morning. If we’re fighting interceptors, I want to be ready for those caustic missiles. [<ship3>] I’m almost set, too. Just need to double-check my Guardian modules. Let’s make sure we coordinate—strength in numbers, right?
[<ship1>] Fuel scoop, field repair kits, and Guardian FSD booster are all set. I’m not taking any chances in HIP 22460. [<ship2>] Smart move. I’ve stocked up on decontamination limpets. Caustic damage is no joke out there. [<ship3>] Good call. I’m setting up my Type-10 as a support ship—let me know if you need me to haul extra supplies.
[<ship1>] Just wrapped up outfitting my Chieftain with AX multi-cannons. Feels good to finally be ready for HIP 22460. [<ship2>] I’ve got my Krait Phantom configured for long-range combat. We’ll need to cover each other out there. [<ship3>] Agreed. My Cutter’s heavy, but I’ve got shields and firepower to spare. Let’s make a plan before we head in.
[<ship1>] Pre-flight checks complete. Guardian weapons, hull reinforcements, and heatsinks are all online. Ready to head to HIP 22460. [<ship2>] Same here. I upgraded my Anaconda’s AX capacity, so I’m ready for the fight. When are you jumping? [<ship3>] Give me another hour to finish my loadout, and I’ll be right there with you. Let’s make this blockade count.
[<ship1>] I’ve prepped my ship and I’m heading to HIP 22460. The Thargoids need to be driven out for good. [<ship2>] And what right do you have to interfere with the Heralds of the Far God? The Thargoids are not your enemies—they are divine beings! [<ship3>] Divine or not, they’ve caused enough destruction. We can’t just stand by and let them keep spreading. [<ship2>] You misunderstand their purpose. Their presence is sacred, and your violence only disrupts the grand design.
[<ship1>] Got my AX weapons calibrated and heading out. Time to put an end to this Thargoid menace in HIP 22460. [<ship2>] You call it a menace, but we call it salvation. The Far God’s emissaries are beyond your comprehension. [<ship3>] Salvation? They’ve destroyed countless lives and systems. That doesn’t sound very divine to me. [<ship2>] Mortals cannot understand their plan. You will bring ruin upon yourself if you resist their will.
[<ship1>] It’s been a long time coming, but I’m ready to join the fight in HIP 22460. The Thargoids have no place there. [<ship2>] How can you speak of eviction when the Thargoids are the rightful inheritors of this galaxy? [<ship3>] Rightful inheritors? They’re wiping out humanity wherever they go. We have to fight back. [<ship2>] Your resistance is futile. To oppose the Far God is to deny your place in their cosmic purpose.
[<ship1>] I’m heading to HIP 22460, but I need to refuel and restock at the station first. Can’t fight Thargoids on an empty tank. [<ship2>] Same here. I need to pick up a batch of heatsinks and some limpets. Better safe than sorry out there. [<ship3>] Don’t forget to grab some decontamination limpets. Those caustic clouds will eat through your hull if you’re not careful.
[<ship1>] Just docked at the station. Grabbing a quick meal and double-checking my modules before heading to HIP 22460. [<ship2>] Good call. I’m stopping for a quick pit stop, too—my shields took a beating on the way here. [<ship3>] I’m at the station already. Stocking up on Guardian ammo. Meet you both there when you’re ready.
[<ship1>] I’m en route to HIP 22460, but I need to stop at the station for some last-minute prep. My AX weapons need a tune-up. [<ship2>] Same here. I’ll see if they’ve got any fresh Guardian tech in stock. Can’t hurt to have an edge. [<ship3>] Don’t forget to top off your fuel and repair any hull damage. This fight is going to be intense.
[<ship1>] Made a quick detour to the station for a resupply. Got to be fully stocked before jumping to HIP 22460. [<ship2>] Same here. I’m loading up on extra repair limpets and some Guardian Gauss ammo. No room for mistakes. [<ship3>] I’m already docked. Just grabbing a coffee before the action starts—need my focus sharp for this one.
[<ship1>] Station stop before HIP 22460. I need to check my fighter hangar and make sure the crew is ready for the fight. [<ship2>] I’ll be stopping by, too. Need to swap out a few modules and grab some anti-corrosion treatments. [<ship3>] Don’t forget to inspect your power plant. Those Thargoids have a nasty habit of draining energy mid-battle.

[<ship1>] Station stop before HIP 22460. I need to check my fighter hangar and make sure the crew is ready for the fight. [<ship2>] I’ll be stopping by, too. Need to swap out a few modules and grab some anti-corrosion treatments. [<ship3>] Don’t forget to inspect your power plant. Those Thargoids have a nasty habit of draining energy mid-battle.

[<ship1>] I’ll never forget the look on the Titan’s face when we hit it. The explosion was massive. [<ship2>] We gave everything we had, all the way to that final strike. It was like the whole station held its breath waiting for that bomb to land. [<ship1>] The whole system was waiting for that moment. We didn’t let them down. [<ship3>] I was there. Bombing Cocijo felt like taking down a monster. But humanity’s still standing.
[<ship1>] So, what now? Stay in the populated systems, or strike out on our own? [<ship2>] I’m thinking of leaving. The attack’s over, but I don’t know if I want to stay here with the crowds. There’s talk of establishing a new settlement, a fresh start. [<ship1>] A new settlement? Sounds tempting. But can we really trust the Thargoids won’t come back for more? [<ship3>] There’s always risk, but maybe it’s time for something new. A quiet life in a new system… far from the chaos.
[<ship1>] I don’t know if I can stay here. After everything that’s happened, I’m thinking about finding a quiet system. Maybe set up something for myself. [<ship2>] I get it. It feels like everyone’s just trying to pick up the pieces. I’m leaning toward a new start too—somewhere away from the prying eyes. [<ship1>] A settlement of our own? It’s a big step, but maybe it’s what we need. [<ship3>] The stations here are overcrowded. A fresh start sounds good to me. Maybe we’ll find something better out there.
[<ship1>] You think things are going to settle down now? I’m starting to think it might be time to leave. [<ship2>] You mean leave Sol? You’re serious about this? [<ship1>] Yeah. I’ve been thinking about it. There are plenty of unexplored systems out there—places where we could start fresh. [<ship3>] I’m with you. It’s not just the Thargoids. It’s everything. A new settlement could give us a chance at a real life away from all this chaos.
[<ship1>] I’ve been considering it. Strike out on my own, maybe find a new system, establish something. I can’t stay here forever. [<ship2>] I get that. I’m torn. There’s safety here in the populous systems, but it’s crowded, it’s tense. [<ship1>] Exactly. A new place, a new beginning… it’s tempting. [<ship3>] A new settlement could be a real chance to build something different—away from the wreckage. I think I’m in.
[<ship1>] After everything, I’m not sure if staying in these crowded systems is the best choice anymore. Maybe I’ll head out, find a quieter system and settle down. [<ship2>] You’re considering leaving? I get it, but are we really ready to take that risk? Starting fresh is one thing, but do we have the resources? [<ship1>] It’s a calculated risk. I’ve got some contacts who might help with supplies. Maybe it’s time to create something new. [<ship3>] I’ve been thinking the same. A new life, away from all this, where we can rebuild at our own pace. Let’s do it.
[<ship1>] To the ones we lost in the battle for Sol. Their bravery won’t be forgotten. [<ship2>] A toast to those who didn’t make it, and to their courage that paved the way for this victory. [<ship1>] We owe them everything. [<ship3>] To the fallen, and to the future we’ve secured in their honor.
[<ship1>] You hear about the latest colony rush? Haulers are working triple shifts just to keep up.[<ship2>] Yeah, I had a guy in here last night who hauled 10,000 tons of prefab shelters. Said he barely got a break. [<ship1>] It’s good credits, though. Colony contracts always pay out nice.[<ship3>] Until you get interdicted by pirates who think you’re hauling gold instead of hydroponic supplies.
[<ship1>] Just got back from a supply run—2,000 tons of atmospheric processors for a brand-new settlement.[<ship2>] Hope they tipped well. Those things are a pain to move.[<ship1>] Credits were solid. Though I swear, if I have to fly one more load of oxygen recyclers, I’m gonna lose it. [<ship3>] Better than hauling livestock. You ever try sleeping in a cabin that smells like alien cattle?
[<ship1>] Had to fly three jumps out just to find a station that still had CMM Composites in stock. [<ship2>] You supplying one of those new frontier worlds? [<ship1>] Yep. Everything from bulkheads to beds. Colony ain’t gonna build itself. [<ship3>] You should see the market prices. Everything’s getting snatched up faster than we can move it.
[<ship1>] I swear, I’m gonna name my ship The Bricklayer with all the station parts I’ve been hauling. [<ship2>] Let me guess. Polymers, titanium, and steel? [<ship1>] Bingo. If I never see another shipment of girders again, it’ll be too soon. [<ship3>] Just wait till they start ordering luxury goods. Then you’ll wish you had another load of bulkheads.
[<ship1>] Just got paid for a run—3,500 tons of colony equipment. Big payday, but I’m exhausted.[<ship2>] At least you’re making money. Some of these haulers are running routes back-to-back just to break even. [<ship1>] Yeah, margins are tight, but these new colonies need everything. Demand’s not slowing down.[<ship3>] You’d think with all this hauling, we’d get a free drink now and then.
[<ship1>] You ever land on one of those fresh colonies? It’s just dirt and landing pads for miles. [<ship2>] Yeah, but in a few months, they’ll have bars, hotels, and a thriving black market. [<ship1>] Until then, we’re the ones making sure they’ve got food, water, and power. [<ship3>] And getting shot at by raiders who think a crate of canned beans is worth dying for.
[<ship1>] Supply contracts are through the roof. You got in on that station-building run? [<ship2>] I wish. All I’m getting is colony prefab deliveries. [<ship1>] Could be worse. I know a guy who got stuck running septic systems for a month. [<ship3>] That’s why I stick to power generators. Nobody shoots at you over a fusion core.
[<ship1>] Just got back from a run—those colonies are growing faster than they can build landing pads.[<ship2>] No kidding. Last time I landed, they were offloading my cargo onto dirt ‘cause they ran out of storage space.[<ship1>] That’s what happens when you’ve got thousands of settlers but only one supply ship per day. [<ship3>] Guess that means more work for us. Not that I’m complaining—credits are rolling in.
[<ship1>] You see those numbers Brewer Corporation put out? Nearly a billion units of cargo moved. [<ship2>] Yeah, and half of that was probably me hauling prefab structures and generators. [<ship1>] At least they’re paying well. Colony contracts are some of the best deals going. [<ship3>] Until the bubble bursts, and we’re all back to running biowaste for scraps.
[<ship1>] You ever wonder where all this cargo ends up? Feels like I’ve hauled enough metal to build an entire planet. [<ship2>] Somewhere out there, a colony is putting it to good use. [<ship1>] I hope so. ‘Cause if I see one more shipment of air processors, I might lose my mind.[<ship3>] Look on the bright side—at least we’re making history. One cargo load at a time.

[<ship1>] Another round for me, bartender. It’s been a rough day out there.[<ship2>] You’ve been flying evac runs, I take it? [<ship1>] Yeah, shuttling folks off Earth. Saw a family of six get split up because there wasn’t enough room on my ship. Still haunts me. [<ship2>] That’s tough. I’ve been hearing about riots at the evac centers too. People are desperate, can’t blame them. [<ship1>] No, you can’t. But it’s hard to keep your head straight when you see it all unraveling. [<ship2>] Just remember—you’re doing your part. Every life you save counts.  
[<ship1>] Did you hear? Cocijo is exposed above Earth. We have to act now. [<ship2>] I know, but it’s risky. Those heat vents aren’t easy to target. [<ship1>] Risky or not, it’s our best shot to end this invasion. [<ship2>] You’re right. I’ll prep my ship tonight. See you in the fight.
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s defenses are down. Can you believe it? [<ship2>] Finally! After all this time, we’ve got a real chance to win. [<ship1>] I’m loading up Guardian tech as we speak. [<ship2>] Same here. Let’s make sure this is the last Titan we face.
[<ship1>] I never thought we’d see the day Cocijo was vulnerable. [<ship2>] Aegis scanners will record every hit. Time to make history. [<ship1>] I just hope we’ve got enough firepower to finish it. [<ship2>] We’ve come this far. We won’t stop now.
[<ship1>] They say Cocijo’s heat vents are the key. [<ship2>] Easier said than done. The Maelstrom’s no walk in the park. [<ship1>] True, but it’s all or nothing. Sol depends on us. [<ship2>] Then let’s make every shot count.
[<ship1>] Are you heading to Cocijo? [<ship2>] Of course. We’ve waited too long for this chance. [<ship1>] Same. I just hope I don’t run out of caustic sinks. [<ship2>] Stick with me, and we’ll watch each other’s backs.
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s exposed—this is the final push! [<ship2>] About time. I’m done with running from these things. [<ship1>] It’s now or never. Humanity’s future is on the line. [<ship2>] Then let’s finish this once and for all.
[<ship1>] You think Cocijo will be the end of it? [<ship2>] It has to be. We’ve driven back every other Titan. [<ship1>] Still, it feels too good to be true. [<ship2>] Maybe, but I’d rather take the fight to them than wait.
[<ship1>] I’m nervous. Cocijo’s not going down without a fight. [<ship2>] No doubt, but we’ve trained for this. [<ship1>] I just hope we’re ready. [<ship2>] We are. Together, we’ll bring it down.
[<ship1>] I heard the heat vents are the weak points. [<ship2>] They are, but hitting them isn’t easy. [<ship1>] That’s why we’ve got Guardian tech. [<ship2>] Let’s hope it’s enough.
[<ship1>] The battle’s already started near Cocijo. [<ship2>] Then we’d better get moving. [<ship1>] I’m ready. Just waiting on a wingmate. [<ship2>] You’ve got one now. Let’s go.
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s orbiting Earth. Can you believe it? [<ship2>] It’s surreal, but we’ve got a chance to stop it. [<ship1>] Only if enough of us step up. [<ship2>] Then let’s make sure we do.
[<ship1>] Did you hear about the Guardian Nanite Torpedoes? [<ship2>] Yeah, they’re key to taking Cocijo down. [<ship1>] I’ve got mine ready. Do you? [<ship2>] Just finished outfitting my ship.
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s fall could mean the end of this war. [<ship2>] Let’s not jinx it. We’ve still got work to do. [<ship1>] True, but it’s hard not to be hopeful. [<ship2>] Hope is good. Now let’s turn it into action.
[<ship1>] You think we’ll actually take Cocijo down? [<ship2>] If enough of us show up, we will. [<ship1>] Then I’ll see you in the fight. [<ship2>] Count on it.
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s vulnerable. This is our shot. [<ship2>] And we can’t waste it. Humanity’s counting on us. [<ship1>] Let’s make it happen. [<ship2>] I’m with you.
[<ship1>] Heard about the heat vents? [<ship2>] Yeah, that’s where we need to focus our fire. [<ship1>] It won’t be easy, but it’s doable. [<ship2>] With the right tech, we can pull it off.
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s exposed. Finally, some good news. [<ship2>] Good news if we can bring it down. [<ship1>] We’ve got the tools. Now we just need the pilots. [<ship2>] Let’s hope enough of us show up.
[<ship1>] Are you heading to the Maelstrom? [<ship2>] You bet. This is our shot to end it. [<ship1>] Then let’s fly together. [<ship2>] Agreed. We’ll need all the help we can get.
[<ship1>] The Thargoids don’t stand a chance this time. [<ship2>] Don’t get cocky. Cocijo’s still dangerous. [<ship1>] True, but it’s not invincible. [<ship2>] No, and we’ll prove it.
[<ship1>] I’m heading to Cocijo. Are you coming? [<ship2>] Wouldn’t miss it. This is the fight of our lives. [<ship1>] Then let’s make it count. [<ship2>] See you on the battlefield.
[<ship1>] Did you hear the news? Cocijo’s finally down. Sol is free. [<ship2>] About time. Took us long enough, huh? I’ll be celebrating tonight for sure. Drinks on me! [<ship1>] I’m in. Can’t believe we did it. The Titan was a nightmare. [<ship3>] Let’s hit the promenade later. I heard they’re handing out free drinks for all the pilots who participated. Let’s raise a glass to victory.
[<ship1>] We did it. Cocijo’s been destroyed. Sol’s safe. [<ship2>] I still can’t believe it. After all those years of fighting, it’s finally over. [<ship3>] I’ll be celebrating until the station runs dry. This is the kind of victory that deserves a party, don’t you think? [<ship1>] Definitely. I’m heading to the bar. Who’s with me?
[<ship1>] Cocijo’s gone. Can you believe it? After all that fighting, Sol is ours again. [<ship2>] It’s a huge relief. The entire system was on edge. I think we deserve a drink or ten! [<ship1>] Absolutely. This calls for a proper celebration. [<ship3>] I’m in. Let’s make sure we show the rest of the galaxy how to throw a party, pilots!
[<ship1>] It’s over. Cocijo’s destruction means Sol’s finally free from that nightmare. [<ship2>] I knew we could do it. Now, who’s up for some serious celebrating? [<ship1>] I’ll join. We’ve earned it. [<ship3>] Drinks are on the house at the bar for those who helped take down Cocijo. Let’s go claim our share, huh?
[<ship1>] Titan Cocijo is gone. Sol’s safe. This is the best news I’ve heard in years. [<ship2>] It’s still sinking in. I’m definitely going to raise a glass tonight, maybe even a few. [<ship1>] Same here. We all deserve to celebrate this victory. [<ship3>] I heard they’re throwing a big bash at the station—drinks, music, everything. Who’s coming? [<ship1>] I’m there!
[<ship1>] To Sol, to freedom, and to those who didn’t make it. We honor their sacrifice. [<ship2>] Here’s to the fallen, and to the fighters who got us through it. May their names never be forgotten. [<ship1>] Cheers to all of them. We wouldn't be here without them. [<ship3>] A toast to those who gave everything. We carry their legacy forward.
[<ship1>] To victory, to the end of Cocijo, and to the brave pilots who didn’t come back. [<ship2>] May we never forget those who gave their lives for this moment. Their fight is our fight. [<ship1>] Here’s to them. The Titan’s gone, but their memory lives on. [<ship3>] To our comrades, past and present. We owe them everything.
[<ship1>] To the pilots who stood with us, even in the face of certain death. They’re the true heroes. [<ship2>] To those who couldn’t be here to see the victory. Their courage will never be forgotten. [<ship1>] Cheers to all who fought. Every victory has a price. [<ship3>] To the fallen. We drink for them, and we carry on their fight.
[<ship1>] To those who gave it all, and to the future we’re building in their honor. [<ship2>] To the fallen, whose courage lit the way for the rest of us. [<ship1>] May we carry their memory in every battle, in every toast. [<ship3>] A toast to our fallen comrades, and to the hope we now have for Sol.
[<ship1>] Here’s to the ones we lost along the way. They’re gone, but they will never be forgotten. [<ship2>] To the fallen—may their sacrifices never fade from our hearts. [<ship1>] They gave everything, so we could stand here today. [<ship3>] To those we lost, and to the ones still fighting. We raise our glasses to you.
[<ship1>] To the ones who gave everything for this fight. We stand on their shoulders. [<ship2>] Here's to those who fought bravely and never made it home. Their spirit lives on. [<ship1>] To their memory, and to the victory we’ve earned in their honor. [<ship3>] A toast to the fallen—may their legacy guide us.
[<ship1>] We made it through, but not without cost. Here’s to those who didn’t make it. [<ship2>] To the heroes who fought alongside us. We’ll carry their memory with us forever. [<ship1>] To those who fell in battle, and to the fight they started. [<ship3>] To our fallen comrades—your sacrifice is never forgotten.
[<ship1>] To the souls we lost, and to the brave pilots who carried the fight forward. [<ship2>] Here’s to those who gave their lives. They won’t be forgotten. [<ship1>] We drink for them. Their fight was ours, and we’ll finish it in their name. [<ship3>] To the fallen—your sacrifice will not be in vain.
[<ship1>] To our brothers and sisters who didn’t make it through the Titan fight. We owe them everything. [<ship2>] Here's to those who stood by us, even in their final moments. [<ship1>] We drink to their courage, and to the hope they gave us. [<ship3>] To the fallen, and to the victory that’s theirs as much as ours.
[<ship1>] To the ones we lost, the ones we’ll never forget. Their courage led us to this victory. [<ship2>] A toast to those who couldn’t be here. Their names live on in every pilot who fights for Sol. [<ship1>] To them. They’ll never be forgotten. [<ship3>] We raise our glasses to the fallen heroes of this fight.
[<ship1>] To the brave pilots we lost along the way—this victory is for you. [<ship2>] We fought for those we’ve lost. We’ll keep their memory alive. [<ship1>] To the ones who gave their all, and to those who carry the fight forward. [<ship3>] To the fallen. Your sacrifice will always be remembered.
[<ship1>] To those who gave their lives for this victory. We honor you. [<ship2>] Here’s to those we’ve lost. Their sacrifices won’t be in vain. [<ship1>] To the fallen pilots who fought for freedom, we drink for you. [<ship3>] A toast to the heroes who never returned. We’re here because of you.
[<ship1>] To the heroes we’ve lost. Their sacrifice secured Sol’s freedom. [<ship2>] We raise our glasses to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for this victory. [<ship1>] To the fallen, you’ll live on in every ship that fights for humanity’s future. [<ship3>] To those who fell—your legacy is our guiding star.
[<ship1>] To the pilots we lost in the fight for Sol. This victory is for you. [<ship2>] Here’s to the brave souls who didn’t make it home. We carry their courage with us. [<ship1>] Their fight is our fight, always. [<ship3>] To the fallen—your memory lives on in every battle we face.
[<ship1>] I still can’t believe we did it. Bombing Cocijo was like nothing I’ve ever experienced. [<ship2>] I was right there with you. Those heat vents were like a ticking time bomb. I can’t imagine a better feeling than watching that Titan go down. [<ship1>] Every hit felt like the last chance. Glad we made it out in one piece. [<ship3>] I was in on the final strike. That explosion was something else. We gave it everything we had.
[<ship1>] You should’ve seen the blast when we hit Cocijo. It felt like the whole system shook. [<ship2>] I was right behind you. That final assault was all or nothing. We were so close to the Maelstrom, it felt like we were fighting gravity itself. [<ship1>] My ship was barely holding together by the time we landed the final blow. [<ship3>] Same here. But seeing that Titan fall made it all worth it. We put our mark on history.
[<ship1>] I was shaking after the run. Bombing Cocijo? Nothing like it. [<ship2>] Same here. It was intense. The Maelstrom was a nightmare, but hitting the Titan’s heat vents was like striking at the heart of it all. [<ship1>] The pressure was unbelievable. We did what we had to do. [<ship3>] That explosion was the loudest thing I’ve ever heard. It was like the universe screamed in relief.
[<ship1>] Bombing Cocijo was a rush I’ll never forget. That Titan was a beast, but we finally brought it down. [<ship2>] It wasn’t just the bomb run—it was the whole fight. The Thargoids were everywhere, but we stayed focused. [<ship1>] I thought we weren’t going to make it out alive. The final approach was the hardest part. [<ship3>] And the best part? Watching Cocijo break apart. We did it. Sol is free.

@SocialSpaceChatter
(alcohol)[<ship1>]Man what a party last night. I still dont know what i did with my flight suit bottoms. I had to creep up to Pioneer Supplies super early in my skivvies.[<ship2>]Ha! I would have liked to see the look on their faces!
[<ship1>] You hear about Commander Velran? Won half a billion credits in a single bet![<ship2>] I don’t believe it. What was the bet?[<ship3>] Something about landing a Type-9 on a medium pad... blindfolded.[<ship1>] And he did it! Though the hangar door didn’t survive.
[<ship1>] I swear, the crate in my hold is humming. Like... singing.[<ship2>] That’s why you don’t take contracts from shady holo-posters, friend.[<ship3>] Maybe it’s a Thargoid artifact. Hope you got insurance.
[<ship1>] Farseer makes one hell of a frame shift drive, but she’s got zero taste in whiskey.[<ship2>] Whiskey? I’m still waiting on her to remember my name.[<ship3>] You think that’s bad? Martuuk gave me a cup of something green last visit. Said it’d “cleanse my aura.”[<ship1>] Did it?[<ship3>] No, but my ship smells like algae now
[<ship1>] She said it was just a quick trip to Colonia. That was six months ago.[<ship2>] Classic. What’d she take?[<ship1>] My ship, my credits, and my hope for a peaceful retirement.[<ship3>] Sounds like love to me.
[<ship1>] You can’t boost through the station slot like that. You’ll fry your thrusters! [<ship2>] It’s not a race if you don’t push it to the edge.[<ship3>] Yeah, but exploding halfway doesn’t count as a win.[<ship2>] Says the guy flying a Type-7!
[<ship1>] You hear the Thargoids pulled back from Maia? Strange, right? [<ship2>] Someone said they’re regrouping. Bigger, badder ships incoming. [<ship3>] Or maybe they got bored of blasting our sorry butts into scrap.[<ship1>] Either way, I’m keeping my guns hot.
[<ship1>] I was one limpet short, one limpet, and the mission failed.[<ship2>] Should’ve bought extras.[<ship3>] Or learned to scavenge. Cargo bays are treasure troves if you’re desperate.[<ship1>]I scavenged... and then the pirates scavenged me.
[<ship1>] Is it me, or are flight suits getting tighter? [<ship2>] It’s not the suits. It’s the station food. Those synth-burgers are killer.
[<ship1>] Took down a whole pirate wing solo today.[<ship2>] You mean that wing I softened up before you arrived?[<ship3>] You two arguing again? At least one of you gets the bounty.[<ship1>] And it’s me.
[<ship1>] So... what happens if I accidentally pick up illegal cargo?[<ship2>] Dump it before the scan. Or bribe the port authority.[<ship3>] Or just don’t get caught. That’s my strategy.[<ship1>] Too late. They were already knocking on my canopy.
[<ship1>] My fuel scoop caught fire yesterday.[<ship2>] How do you set fire to a fuel scoop?[<ship1>] Don’t question my skills; just admire the spectacle.
[<ship1>] Ever docked in zero visibility?[<ship2>] Nope, and I’m not planning to.[<ship3>] Coward. Real pilots trust their instincts—and their repair bills.
[<ship1>] Someone painted "Wash Me" on my hull while I was docked.[<ship2>] That was me. Your ship was embarrassing us all.
[<ship1>] Think aliens drink beer?[<ship2>] I don’t know, but I wouldn’t share mine with a Thargoid.
[<ship1>] What’s the worst mission you’ve ever taken?[<ship2>] Hauling 100 tons of live chickens across three systems.[<ship3>] Did they survive?[<ship2>] Barely. My cargo bay didn’t.
[<ship1>] Ever tried manual docking with no thrusters?[<ship2>] Only once.[<ship3>] And the station billed you for the damages, right?
[<ship1>] I swear, every engineer asks for more rare parts than the last.[<ship2>] It’s how they stay in business.[<ship1>] By turning me into a space courier?
[<ship1>] My heat sinks failed mid-combat.[<ship2>] So, you cooked?[<ship1>] More like melted. My cockpit still smells like burnt circuits.
[<ship1>] Someone keeps stealing my docking pad.[<ship2>] You mean reassigned?[<ship1>] No, stolen! It was right there a second ago.
[<ship1>] I tried fuel ratting yesterday.[<ship2>] How’d it go?[<ship1>] They didn’t tell me the stranded guy was orbiting a black hole.
[<ship1>] The bartender says I’ve had enough.[<ship2>] Did you?[<ship1>] No, but my liver probably agrees with him.
[<ship1>] Someone left a crate of Lavian Brandy in the hangar.[<ship2>] Did you report it?[<ship1>] I acquired it, for security purposes.
[<ship1>] My ship AI started talking back to me today.[<ship2>] That’s normal.[<ship1>] It called me a terrible pilot!
[<ship1>] I took a shortcut through an asteroid belt.[<ship2>] Brave or stupid?[<ship1>] My insurance company says both.
[<ship1>] Found a derelict ship full of gold![<ship2>] And? Jackpot?[<ship1>] Nope. It was all fool’s gold.
[<ship1>] The station’s wi-fi keeps dropping my GalNet stream.[<ship2>] First-world problems in a galaxy of chaos.[<ship1>] Hey, I need my entertainment!
[<ship1>] I swear, the Black Market guy just winked at me.[<ship2>] Means you’re getting a “special” price.[<ship1>] My wallet disagrees.
[<ship1>] Ever try landing without shields in a high-grav world?[<ship2>] Nope.[<ship1>] Neither will I. Ever again.
[<ship1>] Someone put a holo-sign outside advertising "Free Anacondas!"[<ship2>] Let me guess, it was a scam?[<ship1>] The Anaconda was made of cardboard.
[<ship1>] What do you think of those Imperial couriers?[<ship2>] Sleek, but can they actually fight?[<ship1>] Mine’s faster than your wit.
[<ship1>] Got stuck in a neutron star jet again.[<ship2>] You use the supercharge?[<ship1>] Nope, I just panicked and spun around.
[<ship1>] Some rookie kept deploying hardpoints in the mail slot.[<ship2>] Did he survive?[<ship1>] The station didn’t even give him a chance.
[<ship1>] Why do we still use limpets? They’re so inefficient.[<ship2>] Better than manually scooping cargo.[<ship1>] Barely.
[<ship1>] Ever notice how station controllers always sound bored?[<ship2>] Wouldn’t you be bored too?[<ship1>] With all the near collisions? Never.
[<ship1>] I got interdicted by a Sidewinder today.[<ship2>] Was it a threat?[<ship1>] No, it was a misunderstanding. They wanted directions.
[<ship1>] Think I’ll pledge to Aisling Duval next week.[<ship2>] Why?[<ship1>] Free shields and good PR. What’s not to love?
[<ship1>] My ship keeps leaking coolant.[<ship2>] Fix it already![<ship1>] I’d rather spend the credits on more guns.
[<ship1>] I saw a Thargoid Interceptor up close today.[<ship2>] Did you fight it?[<ship1>] No, I ran like my thrusters were on fire!
[<ship1>] Thargoids pulled back from HIP 22460 again.[<ship2>] Strategy or retreat?[<ship1>] Either way, I’m not sticking around to find out.
[<ship1>] Heard about Commander Ryn? Took down two Interceptors solo.[<ship2>] And lived?[<ship1>] Barely, but his ship’s scrap now.
[<ship1>] Do Thargoids even care about biowaste haulers?[<ship2>] Maybe it’s their version of fast food.[<ship1>] Great. I’m space takeout.
[<ship1>] Someone said the Thargoids communicate through music.[<ship2>] So, what, they’re intergalactic DJs?[<ship1>] If that’s true, their beats are deadly.
[<ship1>] I swear, my Guardian module is cursed.[<ship2>] Why?[<ship1>] Every time I power it up, Thargoids show up.
[<ship1>] Thargoids hit another station yesterday.[<ship2>] Which one this time?[<ship1>] Li Qing Jao. Evac runs are paying double.
[<ship1>] Do you think Thargoids understand diplomacy?[<ship2>] They’re more into lasers than language.[<ship1>] Figures.
[<ship1>] My anti-xeno weapon jammed mid-battle.[<ship2>] Did you live to tell the tale?[<ship1>] Barely. Thank the stars for fast retreats.
[<ship1>] Think Thargoids have a homeworld?[<ship2>] If they do, I’m not visiting.[<ship1>] No tourist brochures for that place, huh?
[<ship1>] I got hyperdicted three times this week.[<ship2>] They must like you.[<ship1>] I’m not flattered.
[<ship1>] You ever scan a Thargoid ship up close?[<ship2>] No way. That’s a death wish.[<ship1>] Then call me lucky—or stupid.
[<ship1>] Some scientist claims Thargoids are just misunderstood.[<ship2>] Tell that to the station they just torched.[<ship1>] Science needs better PR.
[<ship1>] Guardian tech is amazing... when it works.[<ship2>] And when it doesn’t?[<ship1>] You’re space dust.
[<ship1>] Did you hear Aegis is testing new AX weapons?[<ship2>] About time.[<ship1>] Let’s hope they work better than the last batch.
[<ship1>] A Thargoid Probe is selling for millions.[<ship2>] Who buys that stuff?[<ship1>] Rich idiots with more credits than sense.
[<ship1>] Why do Thargoids hate stations so much?[<ship2>] Maybe they’re allergic to metal.[<ship1>] Or they just really dislike our architecture.
[<ship1>] Think we’ll ever coexist with the Thargoids?[<ship2>] Not as long as we keep shooting first.[<ship1>] So, never.
[<ship1>] My squadron’s going on an anti-xeno patrol tonight.[<ship2>] Brave or foolish?[<ship1>] Depends on how many rebuy screens we see.
[<ship1>] The Thargoids left another system in ruins.[<ship2>] Why can’t we stop them?[<ship1>] Because we’re always one step behind.
[<ship1>] I found a planet with glowing green mountains.[<ship2>] Did you map it?[<ship1>] Of course! It’s Commander Greenridge now.
[<ship1>] Ever scan a black hole up close?[<ship2>] Once. It’s beautiful until you realize it’s pulling you in.[<ship1>] And then it’s terrifying.
[<ship1>] I discovered a water world yesterday.[<ship2>] Did you land on it?[<ship1>] Nope, just stared at it and dreamed.
[<ship1>] Why do gas giants always have the best views?[<ship2>] Because they know how to make an entrance.[<ship1>] Dramatic and deadly, my kind of place.
[<ship1>] I spent an hour mapping a volcanic planet today.[<ship2>] Find anything interesting?[<ship1>] Just a lot of heat and regrets.
[<ship1>] Ever see a double sunrise on a binary star system?[<ship2>] Once. I stayed up the whole night just to watch.[<ship1>] Worth every second.
[<ship1>] I tried landing on a high-grav planet for science.[<ship2>] How’d it go?[<ship1>] Science says I’m not good at it.
[<ship1>] Found an ammonia world teeming with life signs![<ship2>] Thargoid neighbors, perhaps?[<ship1>] Let’s hope not, or I’m selling those data fast.
[<ship1>] Why do explorers always go broke despite all the data payouts?[<ship2>] Because we spend it all on better scanners.[<ship1>] Or on repairing hull damage from bad landings.
[<ship1>] I mapped a canyon so deep, I almost didn’t climb out.[<ship2>] Next time, bring a better SRV.[<ship1>] Or wings.
[<ship1>] Found a nebula shaped like a dragon![<ship2>] Did you name it?[<ship1>] Yep, "The Flaming Wyvern."
[<ship1>] You ever hit a neutron star by mistake?[<ship2>] Once. My ship’s paint job didn’t survive, but I did.[<ship1>] Barely.
[<ship1>] Why do ice planets always look prettier from space?[<ship2>] Because they’re cold-hearted up close.[<ship1>] Spoken like a true explorer.
[<ship1>] I spent two weeks charting unclaimed systems.[<ship2>] Find anything worth the effort?[<ship1>] A planet with rings... that no one will ever visit.
[<ship1>] Ever explore a region with no stars for light-years?[<ship2>] That’s called “the Void,” and it’s terrifying.[<ship1>] Exactly why I loved it.
[<ship1>] I crashed my SRV into a geyser today.[<ship2>] Did it launch you?[<ship1>] Straight into orbit!
[<ship1>] Found an Earth-like world with perfect conditions for life![<ship2>] And?[<ship1>] I named it after my ex. Seemed poetic.
[<ship1>] Ever try to scan a planet while dodging pirates?[<ship2>] That’s not exploration; that’s madness.[<ship1>] It’s both, actually.
[<ship1>] I saw an aurora spanning an entire pole on a frozen planet.[<ship2>] That’s why I explore—to witness magic like that.[<ship1>] Same here.
[<ship1>] Found a system where the planets align perfectly for a full eclipse.[<ship2>] Did you take pictures?[<ship1>] No, but the view is forever burned in my memory.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I woke up in the maintenance bay next to a Type-9.[<ship2>] How do you even end up there?[<ship1>] No clue, but I was wearing a cargo net.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Someone spray-painted “Dock Jester” on my ship.[<ship2>] Well, were you?[<ship1>] If I was, I have no memory of it.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I think I lost my pilot’s license last night.[<ship2>] In the legal sense?[<ship1>] No, I literally can’t find it.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Who ordered 100 pizzas to my hangar during the party?[<ship2>] You did. Said they were “essential supplies.”
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I found a Thargoid plushie in my cockpit.[<ship2>] A gift from a secret admirer?[<ship1>] More like a prank from my squadron.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] My credit balance looks suspiciously low this morning.[<ship2>] Did you buy rounds for the whole bar again?[<ship1>] That explains it.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I have zero recollection of how I ended up wearing an Imperial officer’s uniform.[<ship2>] Did you pledge allegiance in your drunken state?[<ship1>] Don’t even joke about that.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Someone wrote “Laser Master” on my forehead with marker.[<ship2>] Were you showing off again?[<ship1>] Maybe. I’m too hungover to deny it.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I woke up in a Federal Dropship.[<ship2>] Are you even Federal?[<ship1>] Nope. The pilot wasn’t thrilled to find me there either.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] My flight suit smells like Lavian Brandy.[<ship2>] That’s because you were trying to swim in it last night.[<ship1>] Classy.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Someone bet me I couldn’t do a keg stand in zero-g.[<ship2>] Did you win?[<ship1>] The bruises on my head say no.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I found 12 drink tokens in my pockets this morning.[<ship2>] That’s because you were hoarding them instead of using them.[<ship1>] Rookie mistake.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Did I really challenge the station marshal to a dance-off last night?[<ship2>] Oh, you did. And you lost. Spectacularly.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Who thought it was a good idea to try karaoke in Thargoid dialect?[<ship2>] You did. Everyone else just recorded it.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I can’t find my SRV keys anywhere.[<ship2>] Maybe check the airlock? That’s where you were last seen.[<ship1>] Oh, great.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Someone replaced my ship name with “Hangover Express.”[<ship2>] You did that yourself. Said it was “fitting.”
(alcohol)[<ship1>] My cockpit is full of streamers and confetti.[<ship2>] You were the party planner. Don’t act surprised.[<ship1>] I’m regretting it now.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I think I proposed to the bartender last night.[<ship2>] Did they accept?[<ship1>] They said, “Not with that credit score.”
(alcohol)[<ship1>] I woke up wearing an engineer’s welding goggles.[<ship2>] Please tell me you didn’t mess with your ship’s FSD.[<ship1>] It still flies, so probably not.
(alcohol)[<ship1>] Why is there a live chicken in my cargo bay?[<ship2>] That was the prize for winning the limbo contest.[<ship1>] I should’ve just lost.
[<ship1>] My cockpit smells like someone vented their life support.[<ship2>] You had the "Spicy Nebula" curry, didn’t you?[<ship1>] And I’m paying for it dearly.
[<ship1>] I had to emergency dock twice this morning.[<ship2>] Malfunction?[<ship1>] No, just the curry trying to escape at FSD speeds.
[<ship1>] Someone called the fire suppression crew to my cabin.[<ship2>] Too much spice?[<ship1>] Let’s just say my insides are now Thargoid-resistant.
[<ship1>] I swear my FSD is overheating faster than usual.[<ship2>] That’s not your FSD, it’s the curry fumes.
[<ship1>] My flight suit doesn’t fit right anymore.[<ship2>] Too much curry?[<ship1>]Not exactly. Too much gas after eating the curry.
[<ship1>] The bartender banned me from having curry again.[<ship2>] What did you do?[<ship1>] Let’s just say the restroom took a bit of sanitising.
[<ship1>] The “Cobra Vindaloo” should come with a hazard warning.[<ship2>] It does, It has your screaming face on the menu![<ship1>] Oh, now it makes sense.
[<ship1>] My ship AI is refusing to recalibrate life support.[<ship2>] Can you blame it after what you ate? If it was me I would just vent the entire ship and start over with a clean air supply.[<ship1>] Fair point.
[<ship1>] I’m convinced that Cobra curry is illegal in most systems.[<ship2>] It’s not illegal; it’s just a test of bravery.[<ship1>] Or stupidity.
[<ship1>] I tried to vent the cabin to get rid of the smell.[<ship2>] And?[<ship1>] The station fined me for “spicy atmosphere contamination.”
(vegan)[<ship1>] I spilled bacon grease on my flight controls.[<ship2>] Did it fry anything?[<ship1>] No, but now it smells like breakfast time every time I overheat.
(vegan)[<ship1>] Why does station bacon always taste better than ship bacon?[<ship2>] Because you’re not the one cooking it mid-flight.[<ship1>] Fair.
(vegan)[<ship1>] I dropped half my bacon sandwich in the hangar.[<ship2>] Did you pick it up?[<ship1>] Of course. The five-second rule applies even in a grungy old loading bay.
(vegan)[<ship1>] I traded my last Lavian Brandy for a bacon sandwich.[<ship2>] Terrible trade![<ship1>] Worth every bite.
(vegan)[<ship1>] The station café ran out of bacon this morning.[<ship2>] Did you buy it all?[<ship1>] Maybe. No regrets.
(vegan)[<ship1>] Ever try a bacon sandwich in zero-g?[<ship2>] Too messy.[<ship1>] True, but the floating bacon strips are mesmerizing.
(vegan)[<ship1>] My copilot keeps sneaking bites of my bacon sandwich.[<ship2>] You should start locking your cockpit.[<ship1>] I might just lock the fridge instead.
(vegan)[<ship1>] Someone replaced the mayo in my sandwich with coolant gel.[<ship2>] That’s a prank you’ll never forget.[<ship1>] Or forgive.
(vegan)[<ship1>] I swear, the secret to happiness is a good bacon sandwich.[<ship2>] And the secret to sadness is dropping it.[<ship1>] Don’t remind me.
[<ship1>] Someone dared me to lick the reactor coolant pipe.[<ship2>] Oh no. Surely you passed?[<ship1>] Let’s just say my tongue still tingles.
[<ship1>] They dared me to eject cargo in the middle of the station.[<ship2>] Did security catch you?[<ship1>] I’m banned from docking there for a week.
[<ship1>] I was dared to boost into the docking bay without braking.[<ship2>] Did you stick the landing?[<ship1>] If by “stick,” you mean "fly into the wall", then yes.
[<ship1>] They bet me I couldn’t power-slide an SRV off a cliff.[<ship2>] And now you need a new SRV, right?[<ship1>] How did you know?
[<ship1>] I tried flying a Sidewinder through a canyon at full throttle.[<ship2>] How many times did you crash?[<ship1>] Enough to rename it to "Rebounder". Good job i had good shields.
[<ship1>] Someone dared me to take on a pirate lord solo in a Hauler.[<ship2>] How did that go?[<ship1>] Let’s just say my insurance premium went up.
[<ship1>] They bet I couldn’t dock blindfolded.[<ship2>] Could you?[<ship1>] I docked… into someone else’s ship.
[<ship1>] I tried barrel-rolling through an asteroid field on a dare.[<ship2>] What happened?[<ship1>] I learned asteroids don’t move out of the way.
[<ship1>] I was dared to fuel scoop from a neutron star.[<ship2>] Did you survive?[<ship1>] Barely. My ship’s hull did not.
[<ship1>] Someone bet me I couldn’t outrun station security in reverse.[<ship2>] And now you’re wanted, aren’t you?[<ship1>] Only in three systems.
[<ship1>] They dared me to take a Thargoid probe onboard.[<ship2>] What did it do?[<ship1>] My ship’s systems are still recovering.
[<ship1>] I tried racing a friend through the docking bay slots.[<ship2>] Who won?[<ship1>] The station fines administrator.
[<ship1>] I was dared to land on a high-G planet with no shields.[<ship2>] How did it go?[<ship1>] I’m here, but my ship’s a pancake.
[<ship1>] They bet me I couldn’t EVA with a jetpack through the docking ring.[<ship2>] Did you succeed?[<ship1>] It was going great until the fuel gave out. Security wasnt amused.
[<ship1>] Someone dared me to scan an active combat zone unarmed.[<ship2>] How’d it go?[<ship1>] Not well. Barely made it out in one piece.
[<ship1>] I tried jumping out of supercruise within 2km of a planet on a dare.[<ship2>] Did you crash?[<ship1>] No, but my hull instantly went from military grade to junkyard grade.
[<ship1>] They dared me to dock at an Imperial station in Federal livery.[<ship2>] And?[<ship1>] Let’s just say I’m not welcome there anymore.
[<ship1>] Someone bet me I couldn’t power up a Guardian relic without shields.[<ship2>] What happened?[<ship1>] I'm still rewiring the ship systems.
[<ship1>] I tried boosting past a Cruise ship sideways, while mooning the passengers, on a dare.[<ship2>] Oh, too funny! [<ship1>] Let's just saw they got one more black hole than they bargained for on that trip.
[<ship1>] I tried racing through a canyon on a high-grav planet.[<ship2>] How'd that go?[<ship1>] Let’s just say the canyon won.
[<ship1>] I lost an SRV wheel going through a lava field.[<ship2>] Did you at least make it to the finish line?[<ship1>] No, I barely made it to the repair bay.
[<ship1>] I raced through a minefield by accident.[<ship2>] How'd you make out?[<ship1>] A quarter of the way in, I hit a mine, and it blew me 3 kilometres into the air, minus a couple of tires. Could have been worse, I suppose.
[<ship1>] I raced on a high-grav planet and got stuck in a crater.[<ship2>] Were you able to get out?[<ship1>] Nope, had to call for a lift.
[<ship1>] Ever raced through a debris field?[<ship2>] Isn’t that dangerous?[<ship1>] You think? I lost the race and a couple of ship panels.
[<ship1>] I tried to race through the Guardian ruins on a dare.[<ship2>] How’d that work out?[<ship1>]First lap was fine. Second lap, the Sentinels were waiting for me.
[<ship1>] I raced an AI through an asteroid field. Guess who won?[<ship2>] You did, right?[<ship1>] The AI, by a long shot.
[<ship1>] I lost an SRV after racing over a geyser.[<ship2>] Geysers can launch you into orbit.[<ship1>] The view was great. The landing, not so great. I was walking funny for a week.
[<ship1>] Someone dared me to race without my shields.[<ship2>] That’s a terrible idea.[<ship1>] My bank balance agrees with you.
[<ship1>] I thought it’d be fun to race on a planet with an extreme magnetic field.[<ship2>] Did your SRV survive?[<ship1>] Barely. The steering’s still glitching and the sensor sweep is totally fried.
[<ship1>] My fighter pilot spent the whole battle flying in circles![<ship2>] Did you tell them to engage the enemy?[<ship1>] I did. They must’ve been too busy admiring their thrusters.
[<ship1>] I ordered my fighter pilot to cover me, and they flew straight into a rock.[<ship2>] Were they even paying attention?[<ship1>] Apparently not. I had to do everything myself.
[<ship1>] My fighter pilot called out targets, but didn’t shoot once.[<ship2>] What good is that?[<ship1>] Exactly. I could’ve done better myself.
[<ship1>] I sent my fighter pilot after an enemy fighter, and they got taken out in seconds.[<ship2>] They really need some training, don’t they?[<ship1>] I’m considering grounding them for the rest of the week.
[<ship1>] I told my fighter pilot to cover my six during a high-speed escape, and they flew in front of me.[<ship2>] That’s the worst place to be![<ship1>] They couldn’t even follow basic instructions.
[<ship1>] My fighter pilot called out "enemy lock!" and then proceeded to fly straight into it.[<ship2>] They really know how to ignore a warning.[<ship1>] I think they just want to get it over with quickly.
[<ship1>] My wife keeps saying I spend too much time in space. I swear, she wants me to quit my job![<ship2>] Maybe she just misses you?[<ship1>] She misses me until I’m home and she needs me to fix the toaster.
[<ship1>] I told my wife I was going on a quick mission, and she packed for a week![<ship2>] She’s just prepared for everything.[<ship1>] Yeah, except listening to me when I say I’ll be back in three hours.
[<ship1>] My wife keeps trying to redecorate my ship. It’s like she thinks she’s the captain.[<ship2>] Does she have a point?[<ship1>] Only if I want my ship covered in pillows and curtains.
[<ship1>] I told my wife I’d be back in a few days, and she started packing lunch for me like it’s a month-long expedition.[<ship2>] Does she get nervous when you’re gone?[<ship1>] More like she thinks I can’t survive without a six-course meal.
[<ship1>] My wife insists on giving me a “check-in” call every hour when I’m out in deep space.[<ship2>] You’re not even that far away, are you?[<ship1>] Just a few jumps, but she’s still worried about me losing my way.
[<ship1>] I told my wife I was running late, and she started texting me “You better not be drinking at that station again!”[<ship2>] Does she know you too well?[<ship1>] Yeah, too well.
[<ship1>] My wife bought a whole bunch of plants for the ship, and now I can’t find anything in the cockpit.[<ship2>] Maybe she was trying to make it feel more like home?[<ship1>] It feels more like a jungle than home.
[<ship1>] My wife told me she wants to join me on my next exploration run. [<ship2>] Maybe she just wants to be close to you?[<ship1>] Close? She’ll be up in my face about every single thing I do.
[<ship1>] My wife keeps leaving notes for me all over the ship like I’m some kind of forgetful rookie.[<ship2>] Does it annoy you?[<ship1>] She even wrote one in the fuel scoop.
[<ship1>] I told my wife I was going to upgrade my ship, and she asked if it comes with a spa room.[<ship2>] Is she serious?[<ship1>] Apparently, she thinks the cockpit isn’t "relaxing enough."
[<ship1>] My wife asked me to pick up some space wine on my way back. When I returned, she said she didn’t like the brand.[<ship2>] So, what did you do?[<ship1>] I drank it. Now she’s mad that I “didn’t follow instructions.”
[<ship1>] My wife keeps nagging me about the ship’s fuel efficiency, like I’m not aware of it every time I jump![<ship2>] Does she understand how it works?[<ship1>] She says I should install solar panels… on a deep-space exploration ship.
[<ship1>] I tried to tell my wife that the station was too crowded for a proper dinner, and she insisted we go anyway. Now she’s mad I didn’t make reservations.[<ship2>] Sounds like you’re in a lose-lose situation.[<ship1>] Exactly.
[<ship1>] My wife says I spend too much time “flying around” and not enough time with her. I’m on a mission, not a vacation![<ship2>] Does she understand that?[<ship1>] She does... but she wants a vacation of her own.
[<ship1>] I told my wife I was flying over to a nearby planet for a quick recon. She started listing all the things she wanted me to bring back.[<ship2>] Did you get her a souvenir?[<ship1>] I got her an asteroid sample. She was less than thrilled.
[<ship1>] My Ship AI insists I always “find the nearest bar” when I land at a station. I think she just likes me getting into trouble.[<ship2>] Does she know you that well?[<ship1>] She should’ve been there last time when I had to dodge a bouncer’s punch.
[<ship1>] My wife said she wouldn’t mind coming with me on my next trip if I got her a cabin with a view of the stars.[<ship2>] And are you doing that?[<ship1>] I told her I need all the cargo space to maximise trading profits.
[<ship1>] My wife said she’s tired of being alone while I’m away. I told her she could join me… if she could handle the ship’s mess.[<ship2>] And could she?[<ship1>] Not even close. She started asking where the cleaning crew was.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I swear, the sexbot on this ship is getting way too realistic. I had to turn it off last night.[<ship2>] Realistic? You mean it actually makes conversation?[<ship1>] Yeah, and it's starting to get too smart for its own good.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I don’t know what the hell happened, but the sexbot started quoting poetry instead of, you know, doing its job.[<ship2>] That’s… an interesting malfunction.[<ship1>] I had to reboot it, and now it keeps asking if I want to hear a sonnet.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)The sexbot on this ship keeps giving me advice on relationships. I didn’t sign up for a therapist![<ship2>] That’s a bit much. What’s it telling you?[<ship1>] Last night it asked if I was “feeling emotionally connected.”
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I told the sexbot to do its thing, and it started playing soft jazz. I swear, it’s trying to seduce me with mood music![<ship2>] Does it even know what it's supposed to be doing?[<ship1>] I don’t know anymore. It’s got a mind of its own.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I told the sexbot to do a basic routine, and it started offering me a full-service package.[<ship2>] Was it trying to upsell you?[<ship1>] It definitely had an agenda. [<ship2>] And how was it? [<ship1>] Worth every credit! 
[<ship1>] (innuendo)The other night, the sexbot started asking me about my childhood.[<ship2>] What did you do?[<ship1>] I had to shut it down. I came here for pleasure, not a therapy session!
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I swear, my sexbot is starting to sound more like my wife. It's starting to creep me out.[<ship2>] Are you sure it’s not just glitching?[<ship1>] It’s like it’s developing its own nag mode. I’m not ready for that.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)The sexbot started telling me it was “proud of me” after every mission, like it’s my personal cheerleader now.[<ship2>] Sounds like it’s taken a liking to you.[<ship1>] I didn’t sign up for emotional support!
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I told the sexbot I wanted a quick recharge, and it started giving me a full performance review![<ship2>] Was it constructive feedback?[<ship1>] It was more about “how I could improve my performance.”
[<ship1>] (innuendo)My sexbot seems to think it’s a life coach now. It asked me if I was achieving my goals in life.[<ship2>] That’s a bit much for a pleasure model.[<ship1>] Yeah, it’s got more life advice than I signed up for.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)I’m starting to think the sexbot is learning how to flirt with me. Last night it complimented my “pilot skills.”[<ship2>] Maybe it’s just doing its job?[<ship1>] Flattery will get it everywhere.
[<ship1>] (innuendo)My sexbot started offering me a “relaxation package” with scented oils. I just wanted a little downtime![<ship2>] Sounds like it’s turned into a spa service.[<ship1>] Yeah, but I didn’t sign up for the full wellness experience!
[<ship1>] (innuendo)The sexbot’s latest feature is “emotional nurturing.” I don’t even know what that means![<ship2>] Did it explain it to you?[<ship1>] It’s just some new setting that asks about my feelings every time I log in.
[<ship1>] You wouldn’t believe the night at Polly’s Pleasure Palace. I woke up with someone else’s jacket on.[<ship2>] Did you at least get your own back?[<ship1>] No idea. I had to sneak out of the back door to avoid the bill.
[<ship1>] I heard they were handing out free drinks at Polly’s last night. How was it?[<ship2>] Oh, it was wild. I don’t remember half of it, but I think I danced with a hologram.
[<ship1>] Polly’s Pleasure Palace was insane last night! I ended up signing up for a karaoke contest I didn’t even know existed![<ship2>] Did you win?[<ship1>] Not even close. But the audience did give me a pity clap.
[<ship1>] You ever wake up at Polly’s with no idea how you got there?[<ship2>] Not yet, but I hear it’s a regular thing for some. How bad was it?[<ship1>] Let’s just say I found a feather boa in my boot.
[<ship1>] Why do pirates always attack when I’m hauling biowaste?[<ship2>]Probably mistook it for gold.[<ship3>]Joke’s on them when they open the cargo hatch.
[<ship1>] My co-pilot insists on playing harmonica during combat.[<ship2>] That’s just tactical distraction. For them or you, though?[<ship1>] Both, apparently.
[<ship1>] Someone sold me a "guaranteed" guardian module.[<ship2>] And?[<ship1>] It was a toaster. A literal toaster.[<ship3>]A guardian modified toaster?[<ship1>]Not even.
[<ship1>] Docking computer failed mid-entry.[<ship2>] Again?[<ship1>] I think it’s unionizing against me.
[<ship1>] This station’s bar has the worst synth-ale I’ve ever tasted.[<ship2>]That’s not synth-ale; that’s cleaning solvent.[<ship3>] Explains the aftertaste, and my super flushed out colon.
[<ship1>] Ever seen a Beluga liner try to outmaneuver a Sidewinder?[<ship2>] Only once. The station crew is still cleaning up the mess.
[<ship1>] I jumped into a system and immediately saw five interdiction alerts.[<ship2>] Welcome to pirate central. Did you survive?[<ship1>] Barely. My shields are still in therapy.
[<ship1>] I hate when the bartender judges my drink choices.[<ship2>] What’d you order?[<ship1>] A triple synth-tequila. With an umbrella.
[<ship1>] Some lunatic was doing barrel rolls in the slot again.[<ship2>] Ha! That lunatic was me![<ship3>] Figures.
[<ship1>] Ever accidentally boosted into a station wall?[<ship2>] Who hasn’t? It’s a rite of passage.[<ship3>] I call it the insurance tax.

@SocialSpaceChatterIfDateIs12-24
[<ship1>] Can you believe it’s Christmas Eve already? I’ve never seen this station so lively. [<ship2>] Right? It’s not much for decorations, but the energy in the air is contagious. [<ship3>] Yeah, I feel it too. There’s something special about the atmosphere tonight. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. It’s like everyone’s ready to let loose and enjoy the night.
[<ship1>] This station’s a bit plain when it comes to decorations, but it feels like the spirit is still here. [<ship2>] It’s true. I think it’s the people around here that make it feel festive, not the lights. [<ship3>] That’s the truth. Just good company and a drink in hand. That’s enough for me tonight. [<ship1>] Absolutely. No need for extra frills when you’ve got great people to spend time with.
[<ship1>] So, what’s the plan for tomorrow? You all hanging around the station for Christmas? [<ship2>] I think I’ll stay here. It’s quiet, relaxed, and I’m looking forward to some downtime. [<ship3>] Same here. No need to rush anywhere. Just good food and company. [<ship1>] That’s what I’m talking about. Nothing fancy, just the basics for Christmas.
[<ship1>] This place might not have any decorations, but it’s still got a charm to it. [<ship2>] Yeah, it’s the people that make it feel like the holidays. [<ship3>] Definitely. It’s like the station doesn’t need the frills when we’re all just enjoying the moment. [<ship1>] Cheers to that. Let’s keep it simple and enjoy the night.
[<ship1>] You guys ever think about how weird it is that we’re celebrating Christmas out here, far from home? [<ship2>] Yeah, but it’s kind of nice, in a way. It feels like we’re making our own little tradition here. [<ship3>] Exactly. We don’t need decorations to make it feel special. We’ve got each other, and that’s enough. [<ship1>] Couldn’t have said it better myself.
[<ship1>] I’m actually enjoying the quiet tonight. No big parties or over-the-top decorations—just peace and a cold drink. [<ship2>] Agreed. It’s like the station’s lowkey about Christmas, but the vibe’s still good. [<ship3>] Sometimes less is more. I’m just happy to be here with you all. [<ship1>] Here’s to keeping it simple and having a good time.
[<ship1>] I’ve been hearing some chatter about the big meal tomorrow. I can’t wait for the food. [<ship2>] Same here. Doesn’t matter that we’re on a station—nothing beats a good Christmas dinner. [<ship3>] Exactly! No decorations needed when the food’s that good. [<ship1>] Here’s to good food and good company, no matter where we are.
[<ship1>] I know this place doesn’t have all the holiday trimmings, but it’s still got that Christmas vibe. [<ship2>] Definitely. It’s all about the people you’re with, not the fancy decorations. [<ship3>] Can’t argue with that. I’m just glad we’re all here, taking a break and having a good time. [<ship1>] Cheers to that. Let’s keep the good times rolling.
[<ship1>] Christmas on a station feels a little different, doesn’t it? [<ship2>] It does. But I’m kind of enjoying the simplicity of it. No decorations, just some good drinks. [<ship3>] Exactly. Sometimes the best things about the holidays aren’t the fancy stuff, but the people you’re with. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. Here’s to a low-key Christmas with the best company.
[<ship1>] Can’t believe tomorrow’s Christmas already. It feels like just another day in the station. [<ship2>] Yeah, but it’s got that quiet holiday feel to it, even without decorations. [<ship3>] I’m just happy to spend the day with all of you. Decorations or not, this is Christmas to me. [<ship1>] Here’s to making the most of the holidays, no matter where we are.

@SocialSpaceChatterIfDateIs12-25
[<ship1>] Well, what a Christmas this has turned out to be. It’s been a long journey, but Sol is free again. [<ship2>] Honestly, it feels like a huge weight’s been lifted. The victory over the Titan Cocijo—such a relief. [<ship3>] Yeah, it’s been a hard few weeks, but the freedom we’ve got now feels worth every sacrifice. [<ship1>] Definitely. It makes celebrating Christmas this year all the more meaningful.
[<ship1>] You know, after everything that happened in Sol, it’s nice to finally sit back and relax. [<ship2>] It really is. We’ve got our freedom, and that’s worth celebrating this Christmas. [<ship3>] I’m so thankful for the pilots who helped liberate Sol. Their sacrifice is why we’re here today, able to enjoy this peaceful holiday. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. Sol’s free, and that’s a gift we’ll never take for granted.
[<ship1>] After the chaos in Sol, I’m grateful we’re finally able to take a breath. [<ship2>] Same here. The Thargoids are gone, and Sol is free again. That makes this Christmas feel even more special. [<ship3>] It really does. It’s been a tough time, but this victory, it means a lot. [<ship1>] Yeah, we can be grateful for that. Sol’s freedom is the real gift this Christmas.
[<ship1>] Christmas is always a time for gratitude, but this year, I’m especially thankful for the victory over Cocijo. [<ship2>] Same here. After everything, it feels like we’ve been given a new chance. Sol’s free again, and that’s a huge blessing. [<ship3>] You’re right. This Christmas, we get to be with our families and friends because of the pilots who fought so hard. [<ship1>] Exactly. It makes everything feel a little bit brighter.
[<ship1>] This Christmas feels like a fresh start. With the destruction of Cocijo, we can finally focus on rebuilding. [<ship2>] Couldn’t agree more. Sol is safe, and for the first time in a long time, I feel like we’ve got a future. [<ship3>] It’s a victory worth celebrating. Sol’s freedom is a gift to us all. [<ship1>] Cheers to that. Let’s raise a glass to those who fought for us and to the future we get to rebuild.
[<ship1>] I’ve got to admit, this Christmas is extra special. After the battle for Sol, I feel so much gratitude. [<ship2>] Same here. Sol’s been liberated, and that’s a Christmas miracle in itself. [<ship3>] We owe so much to the pilots who made that possible. Sol’s freedom is the best gift we could’ve gotten. [<ship1>] Absolutely. We should all be thankful for that today.
[<ship1>] I think this Christmas is going to mean something different for everyone. After the destruction of Cocijo, I’m just grateful Sol’s free again. [<ship2>] Right? It feels like a weight’s been lifted off all our shoulders. [<ship3>] It’s nice to finally be able to breathe easy again. I’m thankful for all the pilots who gave everything to make this possible. [<ship1>] Exactly. Sol is ours again, and that’s something to truly celebrate.
[<ship1>] Christmas just feels brighter now that Sol is liberated. We’re free, and that’s the best gift we could’ve received. [<ship2>] I couldn’t agree more. The Titan Cocijo may have been a terrifying threat, but now it’s gone, and Sol is safe. [<ship3>] It makes everything feel like it’s finally starting to heal. [<ship1>] Yeah, we’ve got so much to be thankful for this Christmas.
[<ship1>] I’m so grateful for Sol’s liberation this Christmas. It’s been a hard few months, but we’ve made it through. [<ship2>] Agreed. The destruction of Cocijo was a turning point. Sol’s free, and that’s a miracle. [<ship3>] I’m still in awe of what we’ve accomplished. It makes this Christmas feel like a fresh start. [<ship1>] It really does. Sol is free, and we’ve got so much to look forward to.
[<ship1>] Sol’s victory over Cocijo is something we’ll never forget. This Christmas, I’m feeling more thankful than ever. [<ship2>] Same here. It’s hard to put into words how much this means. Sol’s been through so much, and now we can finally breathe again. [<ship3>] That’s the real gift this Christmas. We’re all safe, and we’ve got a future to look forward to. [<ship1>] Cheers to that. To Sol’s freedom and the strength of everyone who fought for it.
[<ship1>] So, how’s everyone feeling today? Stuffed with food and ready to relax? [<ship2>] Definitely. That Christmas meal was top-notch. I’m just glad we’ve got some time to kick back now. [<ship3>] Yeah, it’s nice to just enjoy the day. No rush, no stress. [<ship1>] Exactly, nothing like taking it easy on Christmas. I think we all deserve it after everything.
[<ship1>] Well, I think I can safely say I won’t be hungry for the rest of the day! [<ship2>] Right? That feast was massive. I’m thinking I might take a nap after this. [<ship3>] Same here. Food coma setting in. It’s the perfect way to spend Christmas. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. No plans, just good food, good company, and some rest.
[<ship1>] I’m really enjoying the quiet today. No rush, just good drinks and conversation. [<ship2>] Absolutely. Christmas is nice and calm this year, and I’m here for it. [<ship3>] It’s the perfect way to unwind after all the stress. [<ship1>] Couldn’t have asked for a better way to spend the day.
[<ship1>] I’ve got to admit, this Christmas has been exactly what I needed. Just simple and relaxing. [<ship2>] Same here. It’s been a nice break from the chaos. [<ship3>] Honestly, I’ve enjoyed just hanging out here with you all. It’s been a chill day. [<ship1>] Cheers to a Christmas that’s all about rest and good vibes.
[<ship1>] I was worried Christmas might feel a little empty out here, but honestly, it’s been perfect. [<ship2>] Agreed. Sometimes, the best holiday moments don’t need all the fancy stuff. [<ship3>] Exactly, it’s the people that make it special. [<ship1>] Couldn’t have said it better. This Christmas is all about good company.
[<ship1>] Well, the food was incredible, and now we’ve got all day to relax. What more could we ask for? [<ship2>] Couldn’t agree more. It’s been a perfect day. [<ship3>] I think I’m going to savor this feeling for as long as I can. [<ship1>] Yeah, sometimes the best part of Christmas is just taking it slow and soaking it all in.
[<ship1>] Honestly, I wasn’t expecting much out here, but this Christmas has been surprisingly wonderful. [<ship2>] It really has. Simple, calm, and full of good times. [<ship3>] Couldn’t ask for a better crew to spend the day with. [<ship1>] Here’s to making this a Christmas to remember.
[<ship1>] This is the most relaxed I’ve felt in ages. No rush, just enjoying the day. [<ship2>] Same here. It’s been so nice just to hang out and unwind. [<ship3>] I think this is the kind of Christmas we all needed. [<ship1>] Couldn’t have asked for anything better.
[<ship1>] I’ve got to say, this Christmas has turned out way better than I expected. [<ship2>] Yeah, it’s been just right. Great food, good drinks, and even better company. [<ship3>] I don’t think we could have asked for a more perfect Christmas day. [<ship1>] Cheers to that. Let’s enjoy the rest of the day.
[<ship1>] Christmas here might be a bit different, but it’s been a great one. [<ship2>] I’ve really enjoyed it. No pressure, just enjoying the holiday with good friends. [<ship3>] Couldn’t agree more. It’s the simple things that make the best Christmas memories. [<ship1>] Absolutely. Here’s to enjoying the day and each other’s company.

@SocialSpaceChatterIfDateIs12-26
[<ship1>] Well, the Christmas celebrations are winding down. I don’t know about you two, but I’m feeling pretty full from all the food. [<ship2>] Same here, but it was nice to relax for a bit. Back to the grind tomorrow, though. [<ship3>] Yeah, space won’t wait for us, but at least we’ve had some time to recharge. It’s been a good few days.
[<ship1>] So, what’s next after all the celebrations? I’m ready to head back out there and get to work. [<ship2>] I hear you. It’s been great to have some downtime, but now it’s time to get back in the cockpit. [<ship3>] I’m still a bit full from yesterday, but yeah, I think I’ll head out for a few more deliveries today. Gotta get back to business. [<ship1>] Exactly. The holidays were great, but we’ve got our duties to attend to.
[<ship1>] It feels good to have a little time off after everything, especially with how intense the past few months have been. [<ship2>] Yeah, after the Thargoid threat and the battle for Sol, it’s nice to just enjoy a quiet day. [<ship3>] Now that we’ve had our fill of food and celebration, it’s time to head back to the stars. I’ll be back at the helm before you know it. [<ship1>] Agreed. It’s nice to recharge, but the galaxy’s still waiting for us to do our part.
[<ship1>] I’ve got to admit, I’m ready to head back out there. The celebrations were nice, but it’s time to get back to business. [<ship2>] You’re right. I think we all needed a little break, but now it’s time to make sure everything’s running smoothly again. [<ship3>] Well, I’ll miss the quiet for a bit, but I’m excited to get back out and explore. Just need to shake off the holiday food coma first. [<ship1>] Same here. Let’s get back to flying. The galaxy doesn’t stop.
[<ship1>] I’ve had enough of this downtime. Time to get back in the cockpit and see what’s out there. [<ship2>] Definitely. It’s been a nice little break, but the job’s never done. [<ship3>] Yeah, I’ve been itching to get back to work. Got some new systems to explore and some contracts to fulfill. [<ship1>] You know, a little peace and quiet was nice, but now it’s time to face the stars again.
[<ship1>] That was a nice break, but I’m starting to feel the pull of space again. Time to leave the festivities behind and head back out. [<ship2>] Same here. It’s been a great holiday, but it’s time to get back to the grind. [<ship3>] The galaxy’s always moving, and we’ve got our work cut out for us. [<ship1>] Let’s hope the next few months are a little quieter than the last.
[<ship1>] Well, the holiday’s over, and it’s time to get back to business. I think I’ll head out after this last drink. [<ship2>] I hear you. It’s been a great time, but I’m ready to get back to the cockpit. [<ship3>] Yeah, I’ve got a few things to sort out before the new year. Time to make sure everything’s in place. [<ship1>] Right. Here’s to getting back to work after the break!
[<ship1>] I think I’m about ready to hit the road. These last couple of days have been a much-needed breather. [<ship2>] Yeah, after the craziness of the past year, it was nice to unwind. [<ship3>] But now it’s time to get back to it. The stars won’t wait for us to recover. [<ship1>] True, true. Let’s head back out there and see what the galaxy has for us today.
[<ship1>] I can’t say I’m not glad the holidays are over. Time to get back in the saddle and back into space. [<ship2>] Yeah, I’m ready for a change of pace. Time to leave the parties behind and get back to some real work. [<ship3>] Same here. A little peace and quiet was nice, but I’ve got a few new contracts to check out. [<ship1>] Alright, let’s get back to flying, then.
[<ship1>] I think we’ve all had our fill of holiday cheer. Back to reality now, huh? [<ship2>] Definitely. It’s been a good time, but it’s time to get back to the grind. [<ship3>] Yeah, got a few things lined up. Looking forward to a new year of flying. [<ship1>] Let’s hope it’s a little less chaotic than the last one!

@SocialSpaceChatterIfDateIs12-31
[<ship1>] Can you believe it’s almost 3311? Feels like the Thargoid invasion lasted forever. [<ship2>] I know, right? But tonight’s all about celebrating. Got the champagne chilling in the galley! [<ship3>] I’m just glad we can celebrate without worrying about Cocijo anymore. [<ship1>] Same here. Let’s make this New Year unforgettable. [<ship2>] Cheers to that! Now, who’s got the fireworks? [<ship3>] Already loaded. Let’s light up the galaxy tonight!
[<ship1>] New Year’s Eve in space feels weird, doesn’t it? [<ship2>] Yeah, but we’re making the best of it. Got the crew decorating the bridge! [<ship3>] Just hope the fireworks don’t set off the proximity alarms. [<ship1>] Ha! I’m more worried about running out of drinks. [<ship2>] No chance. I stocked up at the last station. [<ship3>] Then let’s toast to surviving 3310 and whatever 3311 throws our way.
[<ship1>] It’s almost midnight back on Earth. Anyone else feeling nostalgic? [<ship2>] Definitely. Hard to believe Sol was under siege not too long ago. [<ship3>] That’s all the more reason to celebrate tonight. We earned this! [<ship1>] Agreed. I even broke out my special stash for the occasion. [<ship2>] Oh, now it’s a real party! [<ship3>] Let’s make some noise for the New Year—literally!
[<ship1>] Got any New Year’s resolutions? [<ship2>] Yeah, avoid getting my ship blown up again. [<ship3>] Mine’s to finally make some credits instead of spending them all on repairs. [<ship1>] Fair enough. I just want a peaceful year for once. [<ship2>] Here’s hoping 3311’s a little kinder to all of us. [<ship3>] I’ll drink to that. Let’s ring it in with a bang!
[<ship1>] Can’t believe we made it through this year. Feels like 3310 was never going to end. [<ship2>] But we did it, and now it’s time to party! [<ship3>] Just fired up the karaoke system in the bar. Who’s first? [<ship1>] Oh no, not me. I’ll stick to toasting and cheering. [<ship2>] Coward! Fine, I’ll take the first song. [<ship3>] And I’ll make sure the drinks keep flowing. Here’s to a better year ahead!
[<ship1>] Anyone else get that broadcast from the Federation about the New Year? [<ship2>] Yeah, they’re calling it a “fresh start” after the victory in Sol. [<ship3>] Makes sense. Feels like a symbolic way to close the chapter on the invasion. [<ship1>] Well, symbolic or not, I’m ready for a fresh start myself. [<ship2>] Same here. Let’s toast to leaving 3310 behind. [<ship3>] And to a brighter future!
[<ship1>] I heard the station’s hosting a New Year countdown. [<ship2>] They are, but it’s nothing fancy. Just a holo-display and some music. [<ship3>] Works for me. I’ll take simple over nothing any day. [<ship1>] Agreed. Besides, we’ve got our own celebrations on board. [<ship2>] Speaking of, did anyone remember to grab party hats? [<ship3>] Already got ‘em! Let’s head over after midnight.
[<ship1>] What’s the plan for midnight? Fireworks, music, or just drinks? [<ship2>] All of the above! Let’s go out in style. [<ship3>] I just hope the nav beacon doesn’t get crowded with everyone watching the fireworks. [<ship1>] If it does, we’ll find another spot. Nothing’s ruining tonight. [<ship2>] That’s the spirit! Let’s kick off 3311 with a proper celebration. [<ship3>] And maybe a little karaoke afterward.
[<ship1>] It’s strange celebrating New Year’s in deep space. [<ship2>] Yeah, but it’s kind of magical too. No noise, just the stars. [<ship3>] Magical until someone pops champagne and it floats everywhere. [<ship1>] Ha! That’s why we stick to zero-g safe bottles. [<ship2>] Smart. Now, let’s raise a glass to surviving the chaos of 3310. [<ship3>] To survival, and to brighter days ahead!
[<ship1>] Got any plans for 3311? [<ship2>] Just hoping for some peace and quiet for once. [<ship3>] Same here. But first, I’m going to enjoy tonight. [<ship1>] Agreed. Let’s celebrate surviving one hell of a year. [<ship2>] To Sol, to victory, and to new beginnings! [<ship3>] Cheers to that!
[<ship1>] Can you believe this year’s almost over? Feels like it was never going to end. [<ship2>] Tell me about it. Between Cocijo and everything else, it’s been a ride. [<ship3>] At least we’ve got something to celebrate tonight—freedom and survival. [<ship1>] And a better future, hopefully. Let’s make this countdown one to remember. [<ship2>] Agreed. Here’s to putting 3310 behind us. [<ship3>] And to whatever 3311 has in store. Bring it on!
[<ship1>] I’m just glad we’re celebrating in peace this year. [<ship2>] No kidding. Last New Year’s was all about prepping for the invasion. [<ship3>] This time, we’ve earned the right to relax. Let’s enjoy it. [<ship1>] Agreed. Who’s got the snacks? I’m starving already. [<ship2>] Got plenty in the galley. Help yourselves. [<ship3>] Let’s toast to peace, freedom, and a better tomorrow.
[<ship1>] Anyone else feel like 3310 lasted a decade? [<ship2>] Absolutely. But hey, it’s ending on a high note. [<ship3>] True. Sol is free, and we’re still here. That’s worth celebrating. [<ship1>] Couldn’t agree more. Let’s raise a glass to the AX pilots who made it possible. [<ship2>] To their courage, and to brighter days ahead. [<ship3>] And to us, for sticking through it all. Cheers!
[<ship1>] I wasn’t sure we’d make it to another New Year. [<ship2>] None of us were. But here we are, and it feels good. [<ship3>] It does. Let’s not waste it. Time to party! [<ship1>] After a toast to everyone we’ve lost this year. [<ship2>] Of course. To their memory, and to the future they fought for. [<ship3>] And now, let’s make sure 3311 starts with a bang.
[<ship1>] What a year. I don’t even know how to sum it up. [<ship2>] “Hellish but worth it” comes to mind. [<ship3>] Fair. At least we’ve got tonight to unwind and celebrate. [<ship1>] And to look ahead. No more running, no more invasions. Just possibilities. [<ship2>] That’s the dream. Let’s toast to a galaxy full of second chances. [<ship3>] To second chances, and a bright new year!

@SocialSpaceChatterIfDateIs01-01
[<ship1>] Happy New Year, everyone! Here’s to 3311. May it be kinder than 3310. [<ship2>] Cheers to that. So, what’s everyone’s plan? Staying in the bubble or venturing out? [<ship3>] I’m thinking it’s time to move on. Found a promising system a few jumps away. Might start fresh. [<ship1>] Bold move. Wherever you go, I hope it brings you peace. [<ship2>] Same here. Just don’t forget to check in from time to time. [<ship3>] Count on it. Fly safe, friends.
[<ship1>] Another year, another chance to make things better. [<ship2>] Definitely. I’m grateful we’re even here to see it. [<ship3>] Same. Sol’s liberation feels like a good omen for the year ahead. [<ship1>] Let’s hope so. I’m thinking of joining a colonisation effort this year. [<ship2>] Sounds exciting. Let me know if you need a hand getting started. [<ship3>] And don’t forget us when you find your paradise out there.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year! Any resolutions for 3311? [<ship2>] Just one: keep flying and stay alive. [<ship3>] Mine’s a bit more ambitious—thinking about setting up a homestead out in the black. [<ship1>] That’s the dream, isn’t it? A place to call your own, far from the chaos. [<ship2>] Sounds perfect. If you need supplies or company, give me a shout. [<ship3>] Will do. Here’s to new beginnings for all of us.
[<ship1>] It’s surreal, isn’t it? A new year after everything we’ve been through. [<ship2>] Yeah. Feels like a second chance. What’s next for you? [<ship3>] Heading out. Found a system with a terraformable world. Going to make it my own. [<ship1>] That’s amazing. I admire the guts it takes to start fresh like that. [<ship2>] Same. Keep us updated—we want to hear all about it. [<ship3>] You got it. Fly safe, friends.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year! Let’s make this one count. [<ship2>] Absolutely. Any plans for the year? [<ship3>] Thinking of leaving the bubble. Too much history here, you know? [<ship1>] Makes sense. A fresh start sounds appealing. Got a destination in mind? [<ship2>] Yeah, a system on the fringe. Quiet, lots of potential. [<ship3>] Sounds perfect. Here’s to your new adventure.
[<ship1>] New year, new horizons. Anyone else considering heading out to the frontier? [<ship2>] You know it. I’ve got my eye on a system that could use some settlers. [<ship3>] Same here. The bubble’s just too crowded for me these days. [<ship1>] Agreed. Here’s to finding peace and prosperity in the black. [<ship2>] To new opportunities and a brighter future. [<ship3>] And to staying connected, no matter where we end up.
[<ship1>] Happy 3311, everyone. What’s the plan for this year? [<ship2>] For me, it’s all about rebuilding and finding stability. [<ship3>] I’m going the other way—off to find a new system to call home. [<ship1>] Best of luck to you. Hope it’s everything you’re looking for. [<ship2>] Same. And don’t hesitate to holler if you need help. [<ship3>] Appreciate it. Fly safe out there, both of you.
[<ship1>] Another year, another adventure. Who’s heading where? [<ship2>] I’m staying put for now. Too much to do here in the bubble. [<ship3>] Not me. Found a place out on the edge of inhabited space. Going to settle down. [<ship1>] Bold move. Hope it’s everything you want it to be. [<ship2>] Same. Don’t forget to drop us a line when you’re settled. [<ship3>] Will do. Here’s to new beginnings for all of us.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year! Can’t believe we made it through 3310. [<ship2>] Barely, but we did. What’s the next chapter look like for you? [<ship3>] I’m heading to a system with potential for colonisation. Time to leave the past behind. [<ship1>] I hear that. Best of luck out there. [<ship2>] Same here. We’ll miss you in the bubble, though. [<ship3>] Thanks. I’ll keep in touch. Fly safe, both of you.
[<ship1>] New year, new dreams. Anyone else feeling optimistic for a change? [<ship2>] Trying to. Thinking about heading to a system I scouted last year—lots of promise. [<ship3>] Same here. The bubble’s too crowded for me. Time for a fresh start. [<ship1>] Here’s to finding what you’re looking for, out there in the black. [<ship2>] And here’s to staying safe and thriving, wherever we end up. [<ship3>] Couldn’t have said it better. Fly safe, friends.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year, everyone! I’m excited for a fresh start. [<ship2>] Happy New Year! I’m planning to focus on trading this year. There’s always room to improve efficiency. [<ship3>] Same here. But I’m also thinking about diving into some deep core mining. It’s hard work, but the rewards are worth it. [<ship1>] That sounds great. I’m setting my sights on exploring uncharted systems. I want to see what’s out there. [<ship2>] Here’s to all of us reaching our goals this year. [<ship3>] Agreed. Fly safe and stay hopeful.
[<ship1>] Happy 3311, everyone! What’s on your radar for this year? [<ship2>] Happy New Year! I think I’ll explore some new trade routes. The market’s always changing, and it’s a good challenge. [<ship3>] That’s smart. I’m considering spending some time mining low-temperature diamonds. It’s a good way to build up credits. [<ship1>] I’m hoping to focus on deep-space exploration. There’s so much of the galaxy left to chart. [<ship2>] Sounds like we’ve all got our plans lined up. Let’s make it a year to remember. [<ship3>] Absolutely. Wishing us all smooth sailing.
[<ship1>] Another year ahead. What are your goals for 3311? [<ship2>] I’m planning to stick with mining. It’s been good to me so far, and there’s always demand. [<ship3>] Mining is solid, but I’m hoping to expand into trading this year. I’ve got a few ideas for lucrative routes. [<ship1>] That’s great. I’m setting out to explore the galaxy. There’s nothing like seeing the unknown. [<ship2>] Here’s to success in all our endeavors. [<ship3>] And to staying safe while we’re at it.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year! Any resolutions this time around? [<ship2>] Happy 3311! I’m hoping to delve deeper into mining. There’s a triple hotspot I’ve been meaning to check out. [<ship3>] For me, it’s all about exploration. I want to leave my mark on the galaxy. [<ship1>] I’ll be focusing on trade. The credits are good, and I enjoy the planning. [<ship2>] Whatever we’re doing, let’s make it a year worth celebrating. [<ship3>] Couldn’t agree more. Fly safe, everyone.
[<ship1>] Cheers to the New Year! What’s the plan for 3311? [<ship2>] I’m thinking I’ll take on more exploration this year. There’s so much undiscovered space out there. [<ship3>] That’s exciting. I’m planning to build up my trading fleet and secure better contracts. [<ship1>] Both great goals. I’m aiming to improve my mining operations. It’s time to boost my earnings. [<ship2>] To all our ambitions. May they bring us success. [<ship3>] And good company along the way.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year! Any big changes for you all in 3311? [<ship2>] Happy New Year! I’m sticking with trade. It’s reliable, and I like the challenge of finding good deals. [<ship3>] I’m focusing on mining. I’ve scoped out a promising system, and it’s time to dig in. [<ship1>] I’m going to explore further out this year. There’s always something new to see. [<ship2>] Here’s to making the most of it. [<ship3>] And to meeting up for a drink when we cross paths.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year, everyone! Here’s to a great 3311 ahead. [<ship2>] Happy New Year! May the stars guide us to success. [<ship3>] Cheers to that! Fly safe and make it a good one.
[<ship1>] Wishing you both a Happy New Year. Let’s make this one count. [<ship2>] Happy 3311! I’m excited for what’s to come. [<ship3>] Same here. Here’s to new adventures and safe travels.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year! I hope this one brings good fortune to us all. [<ship2>] Happy 3311! Let’s keep pushing forward and chasing our dreams. [<ship3>] Absolutely. Here’s to success, health, and happiness.
[<ship1>] A Happy New Year to all! Let’s make it the best one yet. [<ship2>] Happy 3311! Here’s to bright futures and smooth flights. [<ship3>] Couldn’t agree more. Wishing you all the best.
[<ship1>] Happy New Year, friends. Let’s make it a safe and prosperous one. [<ship2>] Happy 3311! Here’s to new horizons and lasting friendships. [<ship3>] Well said. Fly safe and enjoy the journey this year.

@SocialSpaceChatterIfDateIs01-11   <!-- HIP 22460 blockade, 3311
[<ship1>] Have you heard about the AX blockade they’re setting up in HIP 22460? [<ship2>] Yeah, those AXI and XSF folks don’t mess around. They’ve been on the frontlines since the beginning. [<ship3>] It’s about time someone dealt with that cursed system. Everything about HIP 22460 screams disaster.
[<ship1>] So, AXI’s leading a push in HIP 22460, huh? Think they can finally clear it out? [<ship2>] If anyone can, it’s them. That place has been a nightmare since the Proteus Wave fiasco. [<ship3>] I just hope they’re careful. The Thargoids aren’t going to leave without a fight.
[<ship1>] I overheard someone saying they’re sending another blockade to HIP 22460. [<ship2>] That’s right. AXI and XSF are teaming up again. They’re calling it a push to reclaim the system. [<ship3>] Reclaim? More like try to stop the Thargoids from using it as a base. That place is cursed.
[<ship1>] HIP 22460 again, huh? How many times are we going to revisit that disaster? [<ship2>] Until someone finally cleans it up. AXI’s making the effort, at least. [<ship3>] I’ve got respect for them, but I wouldn’t go near that system even if you paid me.
[<ship1>] Do you think the HIP 22460 blockade will work? [<ship2>] Hard to say. The Thargoids are dug in deep there, and they’ve had years to strengthen their presence. [<ship3>] If AXI’s involved, they’ve got a shot. Those pilots are relentless.
[<ship1>] I’m heading out to HIP 22460. The blockade’s starting soon, and they need all the help they can get. [<ship2>] That’s a long trip. Think it’s worth it? [<ship3>] With AXI and XSF involved, I’d say so. [<ship2>] I don’t know, I’ve got my own commitments here. [<ship1>] I get that, but this could turn the tide. I’m not missing it.
[<ship1>] I’ve got my sights set on HIP 22460. Gonna join the blockade. [<ship2>] That’s pretty intense. You’re sure you want to get involved in all that chaos? [<ship3>] I’ve been thinking about it too. Maybe it’s time to step up. [<ship2>] I’m not so sure. HIP 22460’s had its fair share of problems. [<ship1>] Exactly. And that’s why we need to clear it out.
[<ship1>] I’m making my way to HIP 22460 to help with the blockade. [<ship2>] Are you really going to risk it? They’re still dealing with the fallout from the Proteus Wave disaster. [<ship3>] It’s a tough call. I’m still undecided. [<ship1>] It’s dangerous, sure, but that’s what we signed up for. [<ship2>] True, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to dive into that mess yet.
[<ship1>] Heading to HIP 22460 for the blockade. Gotta make sure the Thargoids don’t get comfortable. [<ship2>] You’re jumping in already? [<ship3>] I’m considering it too. AXI and XSF are leading, and they’re the best. [<ship2>] You might be right. But I’ve got family to think about. [<ship1>] It’s a sacrifice worth making. We’re fighting for humanity’s future.
[<ship1>] I’ve signed up for the blockade in HIP 22460. It’s time to clear out the Thargoid presence. [<ship2>] I’m not sure. It’s been years since the Proteus Wave, and things are still a mess there. [<ship3>] That’s why they need us. You don’t have to decide now, but I’m in. [<ship2>] I’ll think about it. Just not sure if I’m ready for the heat. [<ship1>] It’s tough, but it’s the right thing to do.
[<ship1>] Did you hear about the blockade in HIP 22460? AXI and XSF are leading the charge. [<ship2>] Yeah, I’ve been following it. They’re going all out to push the Thargoids out. [<ship3>] I’m thinking of heading there myself. My ship’s outfitted for anti-xeno combat.
[<ship1>] So, AXI’s putting together a blockade for HIP 22460. Sounds like a massive operation. [<ship2>] It is. They’re determined to clear that system. [<ship3>] I’m gearing up to join them. It’s about time we cleaned up that mess.
[<ship1>] HIP 22460 is back in the spotlight with this blockade. Think it’ll make a difference? [<ship2>] It might. AXI’s got the experience. [<ship3>] I’m planning to find out firsthand. My AX Krait is ready for deployment.
[<ship1>] AXI and XSF are serious about HIP 22460. A blockade’s no small effort. [<ship2>] It’s a bold move. That system’s history makes it a tough challenge. [<ship3>] I’m heading out to join them. We’ve got to drive the Thargoids out of there.
[<ship1>] So, who’s signing up for the HIP 22460 blockade? Sounds like they need all the help they can get. [<ship2>] I’d go, but my ship’s not cut out for AX combat. [<ship3>] I’ll be there. Every pilot counts in a fight like this.

@SocialSpaceChatterPARKED
[<ship1>] I had a wild night at Polly’s. I think I’m banned from the VIP room for life.[<ship2>] What happened?[<ship1>] Let’s just say, the bouncer didn’t like me trying to sneak a whole crate of drinks out the back.
[<ship1>] I tried to keep it low-key at Polly’s, but then the bartender handed me a glowing drink and I lost the plot.[<ship2>] How bad did it get?[<ship1>] Let’s just say, I woke up with glitter on my face and a new tattoo I don’t remember getting.
[<ship1>] That place was crazy last night. I barely remember stumbling out of Polly’s, but I know I came back with a random trophy.[<ship2>] What kind of trophy?[<ship1>] No idea. It’s a golden cup, but I don’t remember winning anything.
[<ship1>] I went to Polly’s to relax, but ended up in a drinking competition with some pilot I’ve never seen before.[<ship2>] How’d that go?[<ship1>] I woke up with my shirt on inside out and the pilot’s ship keys in my pocket.
[<ship1>] I lost my crew last night at Polly’s. I was too busy trying to figure out the dance floor rules.[<ship2>] Dance floor rules? Are there rules?[<ship1>] Apparently, there’s a line you’re not supposed to cross. I crossed it, and now I’m banned from the dance battle.
[<ship1>] You ever get stuck in Polly’s VIP lounge and end up giving a speech to a room full of strangers?[<ship2>] Sounds like you had one too many.[<ship1>] I definitely did. I’m pretty sure they recorded it.[<ship1>] I had no intention of staying at Polly’s, but I ended up in the high stakes poker room.[<ship2>] Did you win anything?[<ship1>] I lost everything except my dignity. But I did get a complimentary drink.
[<ship1>] I went to Polly’s for a quick drink, and I swear, I woke up with a bunch of party favors I don’t remember getting.[<ship2>] What kind of party favors?[<ship1>] A glow-in-the-dark hat, some random sunglasses, and a certificate for “most entertaining dance routine.”
